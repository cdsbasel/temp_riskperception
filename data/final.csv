The MDWS exhibited greater test-retest reliability after a 4-week interval (DWS r = .68; MDWS r = .90). In Study 2, the MDWS again displayed a single factor structure, excellent internal consistency (alpha = .95), and good test-retest reliability after an 8-week interval (r = .78). Additionally, results support convergent validity between the MDWS and fear of dementia, subjective memory, general anxiety, health anxiety, and neuroticism.

The measure demonstrated good reliability and validity. Total CWS scores were strongly associated with state and trait anxiety (convergent validity) but also had significant and unique predictive value for mood outcomes (discriminant validity).

This scale is used to identify dimensions that are relevant in the genetic counseling context, such as worry about developing breast cancer, impact of worries on daily life, and risk perception in women attending a counseling session for BRCA1/2 mutations. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the psychometric properties of the CWS-GC in a sample of Italian women. Methods: A total of 304 women aged 19 to 90 years, 58% with history and 42% with no history of breast or ovarian cancer, participated in the study. Validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change of the CWS-GC were assessed. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a 2-factor structure of the CWS-GC measuring cancer worry and risk perception and with Cronbach's coefficients of .90 and .70, respectively. Criterion validity was attested by substantial yet not overlapping correlations with anxiety and fear of medical procedures. In a subsample of 50 women, test-retest reliability at a 4-week interval ranged from 0.70 to 0.87, and the CWS-GC was able to detect small to medium changes 1 month after genetic counseling. Conclusions: Overall, the CWS-GC showed good psychometric characteristics in this population. Implications for Practice: The CWS-GC would be appropriate for use by healthcare professionals to better understand how women react and adapt to information on genetic cancer risk to provide them with emotional support and encourage surveillance behaviors.","Caruso","The Cancer Worry Scale Revised for Breast Cancer Genetic Counseling",2018,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk","worry",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"range","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest","test-retest",NA,NA,NA,"0.70",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.87",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"italy","italy",NA,NA,NA,50,50,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"45.96",45.96,NA,NA,NA,8.69,8.69,NA,NA,NA,26,26,NA,NA,NA,"66",66,NA,NA,NA

Such worry is one of several possible psychological responses (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression, and trauma) to climate change. Within this article, the psychometric development of the ten-item Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS) is detailed in three studies. The scale was developed to assess proximal worry about climate change rather than social or global impacts. Study 1 provided evidence that the CCWS items were internally consistent, constituted a single factor, and that the facture structure of the items was invariant for men and women. The results from Study 1 also indicated a good fit with a Rasch model of the items. Study 2 affirmed the internal consistency of the CCWS items and indicated that peoples' responses to the measure were temporally stable over a two-week test-retest interval (r = 0.91). Study 3 provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of the CCWS through its pattern of correlations with several established clinical and weather-related measures.

Our principal aim was to develop a straightforward measure of general problematic worry suitable for research and clinical treatment. Our secondary aim was to develop a measure of problematic worry specifically concerning paranoid fears. Methods An item pool concerning worry in the past month was evaluated in 250 non-clinical individuals and 50 patients with psychosis in a worry treatment trial. Exploratory factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) informed the selection of scale items. IRT analyses were repeated with the scales administered to 273 non-clinical individuals, 79 patients with psychosis and 93 patients with social anxiety disorder. Other clinical measures were administered to assess concurrent validity. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 75 participants. Sensitivity to change was assessed with 43 patients with psychosis. Results A 10-item general worry scale (Dunn Worry Questionnaire; DWQ) and a five-item paranoia worry scale (Paranoia Worries Questionnaire; PWQ) were developed. All items were highly discriminative (DWQ a = 1.98-5.03; PWQ a = 4.10-10.7), indicating small increases in latent worry lead to a high probability of item endorsement. The DWQ was highly informative across a wide range of the worry distribution, whilst the PWQ had greatest precision at clinical levels of paranoia worry. The scales demonstrated excellent internal reliability, test-retest reliability, concurrent validity and sensitivity to change. Conclusions The new measures of general problematic worry and worry about paranoid fears have excellent psychometric properties.","Freeman","The Dunn Worry Questionnaire and the Paranoia Worries Questionnaire: new assessments of worry",2020,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"40",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.97",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"clinical/patients",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"uk",NA,NA,NA,NA,75,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assessed the feasibility, patient acceptability of and compliance of a new surveillance strategy for ovarian cancer surveillance in women with BRCA mutations, based on assessments of serum CA125 and HE4 every 4 months (Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) arm), compared to Standard of Care (SOC) surveillance with CA125 blood tests and pelvic ultrasounds every 6 months. Methods. Women were recruited 6/13/16-9/11/17 from an integrated health care system in California for this non-randomized prospective cohort study. Women were invited to participate in a novel serum biomarker surveillance strategy using ROCA or they could opt to be in the standard of care control arm with ultrasound and CA 125 every 6 months. Outcomes assessed included compliance, self-reported distress using the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and cancer anxiety using the Cancer Worry Scale. Results. There were 159 women in the ROCA arm and 43 in the SOC arm. Overall, compliance was higher in the ROCA arm (832%) than in SOC (51.9%), p < 0.0001. Based on the IES, ROCA arm women reported less feelings about intrusion and avoidance at 12 months compared to baseline; the difference approached significance for intrusion (7.6% vs 4.1% severe, p = 0.057) and was statistically significant for avoidance (20.8% vs 9.9% severe, p = 0.034). Conclusions. This pilot demonstrated that compliance was high with blood tests performed every four months for ovarian cancer surveillance. Moreover, ROCA women had lower stress scores over time than SOC women. Given the lack of clinical utility and poor compliance shown with traditional ultrasound and CA125 tests, further investigation is warranted of longitudinal biomarker surveillance for early detection of ovarian cancer.

Methods Participants underwent Mohs surgery for facial basal or squamous cell carcinoma or excision of early facial melanoma. Cohort 1 received a set of scales before and after surgery. Cohort 2 received the scales on two occasions in the post operative period for test-retest reliability. Rasch measurement theory was used to select (item-reduce) the most clinically meaningful items for the scales. Reliability, validity, floor and ceiling effects and responsiveness were also analysed. Results Of 334 patients, 209 (response rate 62.6%) were included. Rasch analysis reduced the total scale items from 77 to 41. All items had ordered thresholds and good psychometric fit. Reliability was high (Person separation index and Cronbach's alpha >= 0.90) and scales measuring similar constructs were correlated. High floor and ceiling effects were seen for the scales. The Cancer Worry scale demonstrated responsiveness (P = 0.004). Conclusions The FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module meet the requirements of the Rasch model providing linearized measurement.

To identify pregnancy worries in women by assessing the intensity of these worries and how they change over the course of pregnancy, as well as their relations with sociodemographic and clinical variables. Design. Longitudinal study using a postal questionnaire. Setting. University hospital in Madrid. Population. 285 pregnant women. Method. Women were asked about their pregnancy-specific worries in their first trimester (mean gestational age 14.4 weeks) and third trimester (mean gestational age 34.3 weeks). Main Outcome Measures. The women completed a questionnaire that included sociodemographic information and the Cambridge Worry Scale. Results. Pregnancy worries were significantly reduced during the third trimester. The main concern throughout gestation was worry about fetal health. Multiparity and pregnancy planning protected women from pregnancy worries, whereas having had a miscarriage had a negative effect. A younger age and being employed contributed to greater socioeconomic worries. Conclusions. Worries related to the health of the fetus are universal across different nationalities. A first pregnancy, unplanned pregnancy, and previous miscarriage are risk factors that influence the intensity of a woman's worries. To improve the health and quality of life of pregnant women, a holistic approach to their care should include evaluation of their worries and appropriate intervention in particular groups considered at risk.","Peñacoba-Puente","Pregnancy worries: a longitudinal study of Spanish women",2011,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: pregnancy worries",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"only female",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,285,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"31.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,4.9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results: Acceptance of restrictive policies increased with participants' age and employment in the health-care sector; cognitive and particularly affective risk perceptions were further significant predictors. Acceptance increased over time, as trust in institutions became more relevant and trust in media became less relevant. The cluster analysis further indicated that having a higher education increased the gap between knowledge and behaviour. Trust in institutions was related to conversion of knowledge into action. Conclusion: Identifying relevant principles that increase acceptance will remain crucial to the develop-ment of strategies that help adjust behaviour to con-trol the pandemic, possibly for years to come. Based on our findings, we provide operational recommenda-tions for health authorities regarding data collection, health communication and outreach.","Betsch","The four weeks before lockdown during the COVID-19

Design Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. Setting Nationwide general population in South Korea. Participants Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. Primary and secondary outcome measures The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. Results Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. Conclusions This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for effective risk communication.","Jang","Influence of trust on two different risk perceptions as an affective and cognitive dimension during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea: serial cross-sectional surveys",2020,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: trust",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"south korea",NA,NA,NA,NA,4010,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.505,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is mirrored by older people showing preventive health behaviors more frequently. However, collective action across all age groups is necessary to reduce transmission. Therefore, this study assessed whether age differences are moderated by policy changes and whether policies further moderate the relationship between psychological determinants of behavior (risk perceptions and trust), age, and preventive behaviors. Risk perceptions, trust in institutions, self-reported frequency of preventive behaviors (mask-wearing, avoiding social gatherings), and demographics (e.g., age) were collected within the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO), a German serial cross-sectional survey. A total of 19,069 participants across 20 measurement points were included (online sample, quota-representative for Age x Gender and federal state in Germany; mid-April to the end of November 2020). Regression analyses showed that age differences in avoiding social gatherings and mask-wearing remained stable under different health policies but were further moderated by psychological variables. The introduction of stricter policies alone was not related to higher adoption rates of preventive behaviors, but it mitigated the effects of age and risk perceptions. Moreover, under mandatory policies, the correlation between trust in institutions and behaviors was amplified. The present research made a strong case for quality, targeted health, and risk communication. Without mandatory policies, the importance of preventive behaviors must be well understood to achieve high adherence - especially in young people who are threatened by the disease less directly.","Korn","Age Differences in COVID-19 Preventive Behavior",2021,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: covid-19",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objectives: The present study aimed to explore two different hypotheses separately for tobacco, alcohol and cannabis: influences from risk perception on behavior (motivational hypothesis) and influences from behavior on risk perception (risk reappraisal hypothesis). Methods: A prospective and longitudinal cross-lagged panel design was used with substance use and risk perception measured five times over the course of 10 years. Participants were 318 German youths aged 14-15 at the beginning of the study. Risk perception and substance use frequency were measured using self-reports. Results: Structural equation modeling indicated significant influences of risk perception on substance use behavior for all substances, which supports the motivational hypothesis. Changes in risk perception predict changes in future substance use of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis. Specifically for cannabis, influences of substance use on risk perception can also be shown, thus, supporting the risk reappraisal hypothesis. Conclusions: While there is support for the rationale behind adequate risk perception as a goal of preventive interventions, the possibility of risk reappraisal should not be neglected, especially regarding illicit substances.","Grevenstein","Development of Risk Perception and Substance Use of Tobacco, Alcohol and Cannabis Among Adolescents and Emerging Adults: Evidence of Directional Influences",2015,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; drugs; other: substance use of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,730,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"students",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adolescents",NA,NA,NA,NA,"germany",NA,NA,NA,NA,318,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.51,NA,NA,NA,NA,"14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,"24",NA,NA,NA,NA

Cross-lag analysis found that for positive emotions, T2 positive emotions could negatively predict T3 epidemic risk perceptions, and T2 epidemic risk perceptions could negatively predict the individual's T3 positive emotions. For negative emotions, risk perceptions at T1 could positively predict negative emotions at T2, and at the same time, negative emotions at T1 could also positively predict epidemic risk perceptions at T2.

Methods: We analyzed 3 waves of longitudinal data (Fall 2018, 2019, 2020) from 3006 young adults (M-age =24.56, 54.8% female, 31.6% sexual minority, 39.6% racial/ethnic minority) from 6 US metropolitan statistical areas. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) examined reciprocal relationships of (a) perceived social norms (i.e., peer use, social acceptability) and risk perceptions (i.e., harm, addictiveness) to (b) number of days of cigarette, e-cigarette, and cannabis use in the past 30 days, respectively. Results: At baseline, lifetime and past 30-day use prevalence was: 61.8% and 26.9% for cigarettes, 57.7% and 37.7% for e-cigarettes, and 70.7% and 39.2% for cannabis. Perceived social norms and use of cigarettes and ecigarettes decreased over time, and risk perceptions increased (except cigarettes showed stable perceived harm). Regarding cannabis, perceived social norms and use increased, yet perceived harm and addictiveness also increased. CLPM indicated that greater perceived social norms predicted greater cigarette, e-cigarette, and cannabis use over time, and vice versa. While greater perceived risk predicted less e-cigarette and cannabis use and vice versa, this did not hold true for cigarettes: use predicted lower perceived risk, but risk perceptions did not predict later use. Conclusions: Tobacco and cannabis intervention and regulatory efforts should address health risks of use, particularly of e-cigarettes and cannabis, as well as denormalizing use.","Romm","The reciprocal relationships of social norms and risk perceptions to cigarette, e-cigarette, and cannabis use: Cross-lagged panel analyses among US young adults in a longitudinal study",2022,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; drugs; other: social",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"young adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3006,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.54,NA,NA,NA,NA,"24.56",NA,NA,NA,NA,4.72,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,"34",NA,NA,NA,NA

Media are often the sole source of information about public risk perceptions. Yet, media typically only report the most severe risks. By studying perceptions of different types of risks - among people with varying exposure to risks - we demonstrate how social science research can complement media reporting. We conducted a longitudinal questionnaire study into public risk perceptions of earthquakes caused by gas production in the province of Groningen, the Netherlands. While the media have reported multiple high risks and strong negative emotions, we found that people were mostly concerned about the risks for properties and for the image of the province of Groningen. Feeling powerless was the strongest negative emotion. People also evaluated mitigation measures as urgent but poorly implemented. Our results suggest that appropriate risk assessment and management need to follow a multimethod approach.

To examine the current status of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors practiced during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors affecting behavioral activities, we compared to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. Methods: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged >= 18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected poststratification by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmissionreducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. Results: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%-58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%-92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%.

Materials and Methods: Data were drawn from the Turkish COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring, between July-December 2020, a serial online cross-sectional survey. The sample comprised 3888 adult respondents. Attitudes to vaccines and trust were investigated in 3 periods corresponding to the timeline of pandemic-related events in Turkey. Results: In the third period of our study, in parallel with the increase in the spread of COVID-19, vaccine hesitancy/refusal increased significantly from 43.9% to 58.9% (P < .001). The significant predictors of vaccine refusal were female gender, being elder, and conspiracy thinking. Having a chronic illness, worrying more about loved ones and the health system being overloaded were significant predictors of vaccine willingness. Less compliance with preventive measures, less knowledge of prevention, reduced risk perception, and higher perception of media hype were COVID-19 variables that correlated with vaccine refusal. Trust in the Ministry of Health and medical professional organizations (e.g., Turkish Medical Association) was the lowest in the third period and vaccine refusal was significantly related to the decreased trust (P < .001, P = .002).

Given limitations of this prior study that included the post hoc statistical development of the scale and undefined relevance toward assessing worry in younger cohorts, psychometric properties of the PSWQ-A were explored among independent samples of older (n = 115) and younger adults (n = 183). Exploratory factor analyses supported a unidimensional model (breadth and control of worry) that accounted for substantial variance in older (57%) and younger adult samples (70%) and was associated with high factor loadings (.66-.89). Internal consistency (r = .89-.94) and test-retest reliability (r =.87-.95) was strong in both samples. Moderate to strong convergent validity with measures of worry and anxiety was evident (r = .46-83), as was support for the construct validity of the PSWQ-A via its relation to the PSWQ (r = .65-.83) and similar relations with other anxiety and worry measures. Although further study is required, the PSWQ-A may be a parsimonious method to assess worry in older and younger adults. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the temporal associations between these variables have not yet been examined. Using data from the Fukushima Health Survey, we examined changes in risk perception of the health effects of radiation over time and assessed the effects of mental health on such changes using logistic regression analysis. Risk perception for delayed effect pertains a brief on health effect in later life (delayed effect), whereas that of genetic effect pertains a brief on health effect of future children and grandchildren (genetic effect). We found that many participants showed consistently high or low-risk perceptions over all three study years (2011-2013) (for delayed effect: 59% and 41% of participants were in the low and high-risk perception groups, respectively; for genetic effect: 47% and 53%, respectively). Stronger traumatic reactions (50 on the PTSD Checklist-Specific) significantly affected the odds of being in the high-risk perception group for the delayed and genetic effects, with the associations being strongest soon after the disaster: The adjusted ORs (95%CIs) were 2.05 (1.82-2.31), 1.86 (1.61-2.15), and 1.88 (1.62-2.17) for the delayed effect in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, and 2.18 (1.92-2.48), 2.05 (1.75-2.40), and 1.82 (1.55-2.15) for the genetic effect.

We find that although risk perception varies between the time points surveyed, it is consistently, significantly, and positively correlated with the reported adoption of protective health behaviours, such as wearing face masks or social distancing. There is also an increase in reported health protective behaviours in the UK between March 2020 and January 2021. The strength of the association between risk perception and behaviour varies by time point, with a stronger relationship in January 2021 compared to March and May 2020. We also assess the stability of the psychological determinants of risk perception over time. People's prosocial tendencies and individualistic worldviews, experience with the virus, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, as well as personal and collective efficacy all emerged as significant predictors. With few exceptions, these predictors remained consistent in their relationship with risk perception over time. Lastly, we find that psychological factors are more predictive of risk perception than an objective measure of situational severity, i.e. the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of data collection.

Whereas risk perception has been considered a key determinant of related behavioral responses, little is known about how risk mitigation actions influence subsequent perceived risk. In other words, do actions to prevent or mitigate risk reduce risk perception? This longitudinal study considers the dynamic relationships between risk perception and risk-mitigating behavior in the context of forest disturbance in north-central Colorado. Based on panel survey data collected in 2007 and 2018, the results provide a first look at changes in perceived forest risks as they relate to individual and community actions in response to an extensive mountain pine beetle outbreak. Analysis revealed that the perception of direct forest risks (forest fire and falling trees) increased, whereas indirect forest risk perception (concern on broader threats to local community) decreased across the two study phases. Higher individual or community activeness (level of actions) was associated with subsequent reductions in perceived forest fire risk, smaller increases in direct risk perception, and larger decreases in indirect risk perception. These findings contribute insights into the complex risk reappraisal process in forest hazard contexts, with direct implications for risk communication and management strategies.","Qin","Do actions reduce perceived risk?

The purpose of this study was to examine which psychosocial factors derived from the 1-Change Model (ICM) were associated with eating in moderation, and whether these factors differed between adults with a correct (aware) or incorrect (unaware) perception of their dietary behaviour. Methods: This study used a longitudinal design with measurements at baseline (N = 483) and six-month follow-up (N = 379). Eating in moderation was defined as the average daily energy intake from energy-dense food products and was measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the associations between the ICM factors and eating in moderation. The moderating role of awareness was examined by including interactions between awareness and the ICM factors in the regression analyses using the pick-a-point approach to further examine the associations for aware and unaware participants. Results: Participants who were aware of their dietary behaviour had a significantly lower average daily energy intake compared to those who were unaware. Eating in moderation was predicted by awareness, risk perception, social influence and intention. Among the aware participants, eating in moderation was predicted by risk perception, attitude, social influence and intention. Among the unaware participants, only risk perception and self-efficacy were significantly associated with eating in moderation. Conclusions: Our findings show that psychosocial factors may only predict eating in moderation when people are aware of their risk behaviour. Therefore, interventions aimed at promoting complex behaviours, such as eating in moderation, should first focus on improving individuals' awareness of their risk behaviour before targeting motivational factors.

Previous construction safety studies on risk perception quantification have not considered affective risk perception of construction workers or conducted comprehensive reliability and validity testing. Thus, this study aims to fill this need by developing a psychometrically sound instrument - the Construction Worker Risk Perception (CoWoRP) Scale - to assess the risk perception of construction workers. Method: Four phases of scale development, namely, item development, factor analysis, reliability assessment, and validity assessment were conducted with the collection and testing of data from a group (n = 469) of voluntary construction workers in Hong Kong. Results: The CoWoRP Scale with 13 items was shown to have acceptable test-retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, as well as content, convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity. Also, the CoWoRP Scale was affirmed to have three dimensions of worker risk perception, namely risk perception - probability, risk perception - severity, risk perception - worry and unsafe. These three dimensions of worker risk perception were negatively correlated with their risk-taking behavior. Conclusions: The CoWoRP Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the risk perception of construction workers and is expected to facilitate the construction safety studies that take risk perception of construction workers into account. Practical applications: The CoWoRP Scale could serve as an aptitude test to identify the characteristics of construction workers most likely to perceive lower risk in risky work situations.

Natural resource-based communities provide a key backdrop for analyzing dynamic risk perceptions and related social-ecological processes. Since the mid-1990s, a mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak has affected roughly 3.4 million acres of north central Colorado forests. Slow-moving landscape changes have taken place as a result of the outbreak, making it a relevant case study in which to examine wildfire and forest risk perceptions over time. In 2018, we replicated and expanded a 2007 mail survey of residents about local response to the MPB outbreak in nine north central Colorado communities. Using the initial and follow-up survey data from these study communities, we examined the changing wildfire risk perception and its relationships with various aspects of local human-nature interactions. The longitudinal surveys showed that perceptions of all forest risks except for forest fire and falling trees declined across the two study phases. Respondents in the 2018 survey also indicated increases in perceived likelihood of a wildfire, perceived severity of possible wildfire damage, and general concern about wildfire hazard. The analysis suggested that evolving wildfire risk perception was strongly associated with a number of explanatory variables and personal characteristics. Higher levels of perceived tree mortality, community interaction and communication, and individual actions in response to forest risks were consistently related to greater odds of indicating increased wildfire risk perception. In general, community social vulnerability, perceived tree re-growth, satisfaction with local management entities, and age were negatively related to the likelihood of having elevated perceptions of fire risk, whereas males and forest-related occupations were associated with relatively lower odds of reporting increases in perceived wildfire risk. Significant influencing factors for change also varied across the cognitive and affective dimensions of wildfire risk perception. Findings of this research have important implications for conceptual approaches, management and policy, as well as social-ecological indication and analysis in forest risk related areas.","Qin","Explaining changes in perceived wildfire risk related to the mountain pine beetle outbreak in north central Colorado",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk","risk",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"natural catastrophe; other: forest and wildfires",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend","temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant","significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3650,3650,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,"multiple samples","multiple samples",NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"usa","usa",NA,NA,NA,1130,1130,NA,NA,NA,0.46,0.46,NA,NA,NA,"59.7",59.7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We found that although individuals' risk perception had little effect on engagement in preventive behavior in China, it did motivate preventive behavior in the United States, particularly at the early pandemic stage. These findings suggest that the perception-behavior link can be influenced by culture, policy, and stage of a dynamic health hazard, and that campaigns promoting preventive behavior by increasing risk perception are more likely to succeed if implemented early, when risk perception is still in its formative stage. Controlling the spread of an infectious disease depends critically on the general public's adoption of preventive measures. Theories of health behavior suggest that risk perceptions motivate preventive behavior. The supporting evidence for this causal link is, however, of questionable validity. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a rare opportunity to examine how risk perceptions, preventive behavior, and the link between them develop in a fast-changing risky environment. In a 4-wave longitudinal study conducted in the United States and China, we found that for Chinese participants, there was little relationship between risk perceptions and preventive behavior. This may be a result of the Chinese government's strict control and containment policies and a collectivistic culture that encourages conforming to norms-both of which limit individuals' nonconformist behavior. For U.S. participants, risk perceptions did motivate preventive behavior in the early stage of the pandemic; however, as time went by and the risk of COVID-19 persisted, preventive behavior also led to perception of higher infection risk, which in turn further motivated preventive behavior. Thus, instead of the presumed unidirectional influence from perception to behavior, our results indicate that the two could mutually reinforce each other. Overall, our findings suggest that risk perceptions-at least in the context of a dynamic health hazard-may only motivate preventive behavior at specific stages and under specific conditions. They also highlight the importance of early interventions in promoting preventive behavior.","Li","Does Risk Perception Motivate Preventive Behavior During a Pandemic?

A longitudinal sample of 538 people responded to a COVID-19 risk perception questionnaire during the outbreak and post-epidemic periods. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we examined the mean level change of selected constructs and differences in their relationships. We tested a risk perception pathway in which affective attitude, informed by experience, shaped risk perceptions and protective behaviors. The model also postulated a social pathway in which cultural worldviews, like individualism and hierarchy, predicted risk perceptions and protective behaviors through social norms. Latent mean difference analyses revealed a decrease in social distancing behaviors and an increase in hygiene-cleanliness, corresponding to a reduction in risk perceptions and social norms and a rise in direct and indirect experience, while affective attitude remained substantially stable. Cross-sectional and longitudinal path analyses showed that affective risk perception, primarily informed by affective attitude, and social norms promoted behavior consistency regardless of epidemic contingencies. Instead, analytic risk perceptions were linked to protective behaviors only during the outbreak. Although risk perceptions dropped over time, analytic risk perceptions dropped more steeply than affective risk perceptions. Our findings supported the distinction between affective and deliberative processes in risk perception, reinforcing the view that affective reactions are needed to deploy analytic processes. Our study also supports the claim that perceived social norms are essential to understanding cultural worldview-related protective behaviors variability.","Savadori","Risk perceptions and COVID-19 protective behaviors: A two-wave longitudinal study of epidemic and post epidemic periods",2022,"osf.io/pa573","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,120,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"italy",NA,NA,NA,NA,538,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.46,NA,NA,NA,NA,"26",NA,NA,NA,NA,6.4,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,"45",NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we used a random-intercept and cross lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) to investigate the association and its direction between radiation risk perception and the prefectural-level relocation (i.e., inside/outside of Fukushima Prefecture). We did this by using five waves of longitudinal surveys between 2011 fiscal year and 2015 fiscal year among the people affected by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. We included 90,567 participants aged >15 years during the time of the disaster who responded to the questionnaire at least once. RI-CLPM was applied to examine the reciprocal relationship between radiation risk perception and locations. We used two radiation risk perception indicators (i.e., genetic effect and delayed effect) and two handling methods on missing data (i.e., listwise deletion and full information maximum likelihood estimation) as sensitive analyses. The effects of radiation risk perception on relocation were found to be negligibly small. Living inside Fukushima Prefecture reduced radiation risk perception irrespective of the difference of indicators or methods, highlighting that radiation risk perception did not dominantly govern whether people were living inside Fukushima Prefecture, but that the locations also affected radiation risk perception.

In the clinical setting, the occurrence of adverse events is associated with the nurse's risk perception. Thus, using tool to evaluate nurse's risk perception of enteral nutrition is necessary. Methods The draft questionnaire with 37-items was formed by comprehensive literature reviews and semi-structured in-depth interviews with 11 nurses. Two iterations of expert consultations were used to evaluate the content validity, and 4 items were deleted in this phrase. A 33-items questionnaire was used to survey 352 nurses from five tertiary hospitals in China from May to July 2019 with convenience sampling. Content validity, construct validity and known-groups validity were evaluated by content validity index (CVI), exploratory factor analysis, and the comparisons of the different EN risk perception levels of nurses at different working departments and different educational backgrounds, respectively. Reliability was tested by internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and split-half reliability. Results After the exploratory factor analysis, four items were excluded. Finally, the newly developed questionnaire included 29 items explaining 71.356% of the total variance. It consisted of three factors: Risks of operation (15 items); Risks of EN-related adverse events (11 items), and Risks of EN solution selection (3 items). The CVI of the questionnaire was 0.95 and the CVI of items ranged from 0.875-1.0. The results of known-groups validity showed that the nurses with different educational backgrounds had a statistically significant difference of EN risk perception (z = - 3.024, p = 0.002), whereas there was not significantly different between EN risk perception of nurses working in different departments (z = - 1.644, p = 0.100). The Cronbach's alpha, test-retest reliability, and split-half reliability of the questionnaire were 0.967, 0.818, and 0.815, respectively. Conclusions The newly developed questionnaire for assessing nurse's EN risk perception showed good reliability and validity. It can be used as a tool for nursing managers to assess Chinese nurses' EN risk perception ability, so as to help to reduce the occurrence of adverse events during EN implementation.","Feng","Development and psychometric testing of a questionnaire to assess Nurse’s perception of risks during enteral nutrition",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"37",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: questionnaire",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.815",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"experts",NA,NA,NA,NA,"workers",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china",NA,NA,NA,NA,34,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 may hold an outsized benefit for TFWs, particularly those living in congregate settings where protective measures such as social distancing are not possible. While some studies of migrant destination countries have included migrants, no study to date has sought to understand variations in vaccine hesitancy among individuals in a single migrant source population across different destinations. Such a design is critical for understanding how the context of immigration affects levels of hesitancy among migrants from similar conditions of origin. This observational study leverages longitudinal data from an ongoing monthly rapid-response survey of TFWs from Bangladesh (n = 360). Overall vaccine hesitancy was 25%, with significant variation by host country. Multivariate analyses confirmed that immigration system factors and threat perception are the strongest predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for TFWs. The predicted probability of hesitancy for an undocumented TFW was 0.405, while the predicted probability for those with valid visas was 0.207 (p < .01). The probability of being hesitant for TFWs who were worried about getting COVID-19 was 0.129 compared to 0.305 (p < .01) for those who were not worried. Results reveal low vaccine hesitancy among TFWs from Bangladesh with differences in location, undocumented status, COVID-19 threat perception, and level of worry about side effects.

Methods: Participants included 91 sexually inexperienced women aged 13-21 years receiving the HPV vaccine who completed at least three of five study visits. At every visit, participants completed surveys assessing HPV vaccine-related risk perceptions (perceived risk of sexually transmitted infections [STIs] other than HPV, perceived need for safer sexual behaviors), and sexual initiation. Outcomes were sexual initiation and age of sexual initiation. Associations between risk perceptions and outcomes were examined using ordered logistic regression models for sexual initiation and interval censored survival analyses for age of sexual initiation. Results: Mean age at baseline was 14.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.4). Most participants perceived themselves to be at risk of STIs other than HPV (mean scale score = 4.0/10; SD 2.1) and perceived a need for safer sexual behaviors (mean scale score = 1.5/10; SD 1.5). By 30 months, 65 participants (78%) initiated sex. Perceived risk of STIs and perceived need for safer sexual behaviors were not associated with sexual initiation or age of sexual initiation. Older age at baseline was associated with sooner sexual initiation (p = .02) and older age at sexual initiation (p < .001). Results of ordered logistic regression and survival analyses were unchanged when controlling for baseline age. Conclusions: HPV vaccine-related risk perceptions were not associated with sexual initiation or age of sexual initiation, providing further support that HPV vaccine-related risk perceptions are unlikely to lead to riskier sexual behaviors.

An exploratory factor analysis of baseline responses revealed a five-factor structure for former smokers (risk perceptions, worry, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy) and a six-factor structure for current smokers, such that absolute risk and comparative risk perceptions emerged as separate factors. A confirmatory factor analysis of 12-month follow-up responses revealed a good fit for the five latent constructs for former smokers and six latent constructs for current smokers. Longitudinal stability of these constructs was also demonstrated.

Different types of risk perception varied, but environmental risks had similar trends of perception. The perceived benefits from these risks and local GDP had the greatest impact on risk acceptance. The interaction between the changing perspectives of the emerging middle class and the evolving hazard risk landscape may be the reasons for the reduction in risk acceptance. The main findings offer insights for effective risk education and communication as well as sustainable risk management strategy.

"46","PLOS ONE",8,"7",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0068019","Background: Risk perception is a reported predictor of vaccination uptake, but which measures of risk perception best predict influenza vaccination uptake remain unclear. Methodology: During the main influenza seasons (between January and March) of 2009 (Wave 1) and 2010 (Wave 2), 505 Chinese students and employees from a Hong Kong university completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess how well different risk perceptions measures in Wave 1 predicted vaccination uptake against seasonal influenza in Wave 2. Principal Findings: The results of the multivariate logistic regression models showed that feeling at risk (beta = 0.25, p = 0.021) was the better predictor compared with probability judgment while probability judgment (beta = 0.25, p = 0.029) was better than beliefs about risk in predicting subsequent influenza vaccination uptake. Beliefs about risk and feeling at risk seemed to predict the same aspect of subsequent vaccination uptake because their associations with vaccination uptake became insignificant when paired into the logistic regression model. Similarly, to compare the four scales for assessing probability judgment in predicting vaccination uptake, the 7-point verbal scale remained a significant and stronger predictor for vaccination uptake when paired with other three scales; the 6-point verbal scale was a significant and stronger predictor when paired with the percentage scale or the 2-point verbal scale; and the percentage scale was a significant and stronger predictor only when paired with the 2-point verbal scale. Conclusions/Significance: Beliefs about risk and feeling at risk are not well differentiated by Hong Kong Chinese people. Feeling at risk, an affective-cognitive dimension of risk perception predicts subsequent vaccination uptake better than do probability judgments. Among the four scales for assessing risk probability judgment, the 7-point verbal scale offered the best predictive power for subsequent vaccination uptake.","Liao","Comparison of Different Risk Perception Measures in

Yet, the majority of studies that examined this important relationship used cross-sectional data that inherently assume that perceived vulnerability does not change. While these studies have been useful, the assumption of perceived vulnerability as time invariant is a major flaw and has largely limited the practical usefulness of this variable in AIDS prevention and programing. Using longitudinal data and applying random-effects logit models, this study makes a major contribution to scholarship by examining if changes in perceived vulnerability associate with a change to test for HIV among 857 young people in Cape Town, South Africa. Results show that female youth who changed their risk perceptions were more likely to also change to test for HIV, but the effects were completely attenuated after controlling for theoretically relevant variables. No significant relationships were observed for males. Also, females who were virgins at wave 2 but had sex between waves were significantly more likely to have changed to test for HIV. Of most importance was that sexual behavior eliminated the effects of change in risk perceptions suggesting that a change in perception may have occurred as a result of changes in sexual behavior. AIDS prevention programs must pay particular attention to helping youth become aware of their vulnerability to HIV risks, especially as these have implications for risk-reducing behaviors, especially for females who are burdened.","Tenkorang","Perceived vulnerability and HIV testing among youth in Cape Town, South Africa",2016,"cape area panel survey (caps)","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: hiv",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three hundred and one women ages 40-75 participated in a two-part study assessing how format of breast cancer risk presentation affected perceptions of risk. Relative to their Gail scores, women were biased pessimistically about their own absolute breast cancer risk and yet largely accurate about their comparative breast cancer risk. Perceived comparative risk, but not perceived absolute risk or biases in absolute or comparative risk, predicted subsequent worry. Worry predicted subsequent perceived absolute risk and biases in absolute and comparative risk. These results suggest that women's emotional reactions to breast cancer risk are based on accurate (unbiased) perceptions of their comparative risks. In turn, greater worry prompts a re-evaluation of absolute risk as well as changes in risk biases.

Consistent with our hypotheses, perceived threat from events that challenge conservative values was associated with increased militaristic attitudes and decreased willingness to compromise for peace over time, whereas perceived threat from events that challenge liberal values was related to decreased militaristic attitudes and increased willingness to compromise for peace over time.

However, it remains unclear how health-related informational support from different channels affects individual factors and, thus, the adoption of different types of APB as the pandemic situation changes. To resolve this issue, we build a multiple mediation model to investigate the associations among informational support from three different channels, two individual internal factors, and two kinds of APB. A three-stage longitudinal study administered to Chinese citizens from February to October 2020 revealed that informational support from media played the most critical role in facilitating individuals' adoption of compliance APB, while informational support from family was the most significant predictor of the adoption of participation APB. Meanwhile, these effects were mediated by risk perception and anti-pandemic motivation, and weakened to varying degrees as the pandemic situation eased. It is recommended that authorities adjust the focus of publicity strategies in light of the changing situation, and make efforts to heighten the public's risk perception and anti-pandemic motivation. This study contributes to deepening the understanding of the dynamic efficacy of informational support from different channels on individuals' adoption of two heterogeneous APBs, and thus to the formulation of more scientific, and situation-based publicity strategies during a public health crisis.","Fu","Informational support, risk perception, anti-pandemic motivation and behavior: a longitudinal study in China",2023,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,135,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china",NA,NA,NA,NA,1233,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.48,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,"74",NA,NA,NA,NA

Findings suggest ramifications of forest risks related to bark beetles were more complicated than an issue-attention cycle or timeline of beetle activity would predict. Shifts in perceptions of beetle impacts and forest risks, relationships with land managers, and local interaction and activeness of study communities reflected diverse pathways of temporal changes in human dimensions. Ordinary least squares and panel regression models indicated community participation and indirect risk perception (concern about broader threats to community and ecological well-being) had a consistently strong influence on community activeness in response to the beetle outbreak. Community wildfire experience and the perceived intensity of forest disturbance contributed most to risk perceptions.

Results: Patterns of use showed a tight but complex connection with risk perceptions of users. Adolescents consider the risks associated with their own use to be smaller as the risks for users in general.

However, little is known about how a serious accident affects people's acceptance of nuclear power and the determinants of acceptance. We conducted a longitudinal study (N= 790) in Switzerland: one survey was done five months before and one directly after the accident in Fukushima. We assessed acceptance, perceived risks, perceived benefits, and trust related to nuclear power stations. In our model, we assumed that both benefit and risk perceptions determine acceptance of nuclear power. We further hypothesized that trust influences benefit and risk perceptions and that trust before a disaster relates to trust after a disaster. Results showed that the acceptance and perceptions of nuclear power as well as its trust were more negative after the accident. In our model, perceived benefits and risks determined the acceptance of nuclear power stations both before and after Fukushima. Trust had strong effects on perceived benefits and risks, at both times. People's trust before Fukushima strongly influenced their trust after the accident. In addition, perceived benefits before Fukushima correlated with perceived benefits after the accident. Thus, the nuclear accident did not seem to have changed the relations between the determinants of acceptance. Even after a severe accident, the public may still consider the benefits as relevant, and trust remains important for determining their risk and benefit perceptions. A discussion of the benefits of nuclear power seems most likely to affect the public's acceptance of nuclear power, even after a nuclear accident.","Visschers","How a Nuclear Power Plant Accident Influences Acceptance of Nuclear Power: Results of a Longitudinal Study Before and After the Fukushima Disaster",2013,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"nuclear power accidents",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,790,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.32,NA,NA,NA,NA,"57.15",NA,NA,NA,NA,15.02,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, risk-takers display higher risk perceptions than non-risk takers. This paradox might be resolved by removing the confounding effect of risk takers' increased exposure to risk. A longitudinal survey was administered to 255 motorists to examine the extent to which Time 1 (T1) self-reported speeding behaviour predicted exposure-free measures of Time 2 (T2) risk perceptions. Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for demographics and T1 risk perceptions, showed that T1 speeding, and T1 to T2 speeding changes, both inversely predicted T2 risk perceptions. This suggests that successive increments in risk-taking behaviour will lead to progressively lower increases in personal risk perception.

When worry is excessive and nearly uncontrollable, people usually suffer psychological pain. The Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C) was developed to measure worry objectively. It comprises 14 items for measuring excessive, generalized, and uncontrollable worry in children. This study, conducted with a large group of elementary children (3rd through 6th graders, ages 8-12 yr; N=973), investigated the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-CK). The PSWQ-CK showed high reliability by test-retest and also excellent internal consistency results. To examine the validity of the PSWQ-CK, we calculated its correlation with the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). The PSWQ-CK had a higher correlation with the worry/oversensitivity factor than with other subscales of the RCMAS, and it showed no correlation with the lie factor. When 3 reversed PSWQ-CK items were eliminated, the instrument showed higher internal consistency. However, this did not improve its correlation with other anxiety-measuring tools. In conclusion, the PSWQ-CK's reliability and validity were satisfactory, and it is a useful tool for objectively measuring the worry of Korean children of this age group.","Kang","Reliability and Validity of the Korean Version of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire in Primary School Children",2010,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"14",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: questionnaire validation",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.83",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"students",NA,NA,NA,NA,"children",NA,NA,NA,NA,"south korea",NA,NA,NA,NA,883,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.6",NA,NA,NA,NA,1.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,NA,NA,NA

Self-report questionnaires measured perceived recurrence risk and illness perceptions one day and one month after catheterisation. Results: Cross-lagged Panel Model Analyses revealed that higher perceptions of timeline, consequences and emotional representations of illness at hospitalisation were associated with higher recurrence risk perceptions one month later. Perceived personal control was the only illness perception with bi-directional associations: higher perceived personal control at hospitalisation was associated with higher recurrence risk perceptions one month later; and higher recurrence risk perceptions at hospitalisation was associated with lower personal control one month later. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the associations between recurrence risk and illness perceptions can only partly be explained by inductive reasoning.

This study investigated the reliability and predictive validity of different risk perception operationalizations related to skin cancer and sunscreen use in order to explain the inconsistent findings in literature regarding the relationship between risk perceptions and (cancer related) behaviours. Design and methods. Two on-line surveys were conducted. Study 1 (N = 175) was conducted among university students to investigate the test-retest reliability of different operationalizations of perceived likelihood and perceived severity and to assess their correlations with sunscreen use. Study 2 (N = 418) was a prospective study among Dutch adults and assessed longitudinal correlations between the different operationalizations and sunscreen use. Results. Internal consistency (alpha) ranged between .13 and .90 for likelihood measures and between .37 and .88 for severity measures. Test-retest correlations (r/ICC) ranged between .51 and .82 for the likelihood measures and between .58 and .75 for the severity measures. Conditional likelihood estimates, particularly when phrased affectively (feeling at risk), and comparative severity questions were the strongest correlates of behaviour. Conclusion. Conditional likelihood and comparative severity might be better predictors of health behaviour than commonly used operationalizations of risk perception. These measures may be relevant for use in the development and evaluation of intervention programmes, and should be acknowledged by health behaviour theories.

The longitudinal case study, focussing on the Cairns Northern Beaches area, was unique in that it included a social and societal 'pre-cyclone impact' evaluation of various resident communities within the region, and then two consecutive 'post-cyclone impact' studies. The primary research method supported an inductive qualitative approach to the collection and analysis of survey data. Some quantitative methods were invoked to support qualitative research findings. Survey data was collected in five separate questionnaire-based social surveys that were administered between 1996 and 2000. During the study, residents experienced the direct impact of two land-falling tropical cyclones. In addition to this, targeted and focussed tropical cyclone awareness education was made increasingly available within the community. The social and demographic attributes that influence the individual's perception of risk and contribute to our understanding of community vulnerability were examined and evaluated. Changes in the residents' attitudes, cyclone preparedness behaviours and willingness to respond to cyclone warnings were monitored and measured. Analysis of early survey data indicated that community residents generally had some knowledge of cyclones but a limited understanding of cyclone processes and very little direct personal experience of the cyclone hazard. Individually and collectively, residents frequently demonstrated a biased perception of the risks associated with cyclones. The resident community was shown to be fragmented, with limited support being available to individual households. Initially, residents were found to be poorly prepared for cyclones and unlikely to respond to warnings appropriately. It appeared that, in the event of a land-falling tropical cyclone impacting the area, the community was highly vulnerable to unnecessary loss of property, livelihood and - in extreme circumstances - life. By 2000, Cairns community residents were somewhat better informed about cyclones and certainly more experienced. This paper provides some insight into how cyclone experience and education may synergisticly have contributed to a change in risk perceptions and a reduction in the vulnerability of Cairns residents to the tropical cyclone and storm surge hazards.","Anderson-Berry","Community Vulnerability to Tropical Cyclones: Cairns, 1996-2000",2003,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"natural catastrophe; other: cyclones",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this setting there has been limited research; specifically, there is little knowledge of cricket injuries. To support future research possibilities, the aim of this study was to cross-culturally adapt, translate and test the reliability of an Australian-developed questionnaire for the Sri Lankan context. Methods The Australian 'Juniors Enjoying Cricket Safely' (JECS-Aus) injury risk perception questionnaire was cross-culturally adapted to suit the Sri Lankan context and subsequently translated into the two main languages (Sinhala and Tamil) based on standard forward-back translation. The translated questionnaires were examined for content validity by two language schoolteachers. The questionnaires were completed twice, 2 weeks apart, by two groups of school cricketers (males) aged 11-15 years (Sinhala (n=24), Tamil (n=30)) to assess reliability. Test-retest scores were evaluated for agreement. Where responses were <100% agreement, Cohen's kappa (kappa) statistics were calculated. Questions with moderate-topoor test-retest reliability (kappa<6) were reconsidered for modification. Results Both the Sinhala and Tamil questionnaires had 100% agreement for questions on demographic data, and 88%-100% agreement for questions on participation in cricket and injury history. Of the injury risk perception questions, 72% (Sinhala) and 90% (Tamil) questions showed a substantial (kappa=0.61-0.8) and almost perfect (kappa=0.81-1.0) test-retest agreement. Conclusion The adapted and translated JECS-SL questionnaire demonstrated strong reliability.

We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening. We provide suggestive evidence that differential exposure to media channels and social networks could explain the observed asymmetric polarization between self-identified Democrats and Republicans.","Fridman","COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy: Alongitudinal study",2021,"https://osf.io/kgvdy/","longitudinal","threat",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: vaccine hesitancy, political",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,667,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.47,NA,NA,NA,NA,"38.48",NA,NA,NA,NA,12.39,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,"82",NA,NA,NA,NA

A nation-wide panel responded to seven surveys beginning in late September 2008 at the peak of the crisis and concluded in October 2009. At least 600 respondents participated in each survey, with 413 completing all seven surveys. Our online survey focused on perceptions of risk (savings, investments, retirement, job), negative emotions toward the financial crisis (sadness, anxiety, fear, anger, worry, stress), confidence in national leaders to manage the crisis (President Obama, Congress, Treasury Secretary, business leaders), and belief in one's ability to realize personal objectives despite the crisis. We employed latent growth curve modeling to analyze change in risk perception throughout the crisis. Our results suggest that, in general, people's perceptions of risk appear to decrease most rapidly during the initial phase of a crisis and then begin to level off. Negative emotion about the crisis was the most predictive of increased risk perception, supporting the notion of risk as feelings. Belief in one's ability to realize personal objectives was also predictive. Confidence in national leaders, however, was not predictive of perceived risk. Finally, our results demonstrate that groups may experience a crisis differently depending on a combination of personal characteristics such as gender, income, numeracy, and political attitude. Risk management and communication should work in sync with these mechanisms and differences across groups.","Burns","Risk Perception and the Economic Crisis: A Longitudinal Study of the Trajectory of Perceived Risk",2012,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"financial",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among the wide range of risk factors for depression that transpired during pandemic, greater perceptions of individual vulnerability to the COVID-19 have emerged as a major predictor of increased depressive risk and severity in adults. Methods: We estimated the extent to which COVID-19 risk perceptions affected adult depressive symptoms in a longitudinal, nationally representative sample in South Africa. We used covariate balanced propensity scores to minimize the bias from treatment assignment to estimate average causal effects of COVID-19 risk perceptions. Results: The point prevalence of perceived COVID-19 infection risk increased between the third and fifth months of the pandemic, which corresponded with elevations in national COVID-19 infection rates. Approximately 33% of adults met or surpassed the PHQ-2 cut-off score of 2. An increase in perceived risk of COVID-19 infection predicted worse depressive symptoms in adults four months later. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the widespread mental health burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasize the importance of greater psychological resources and structural changes to promote equitable access to COVID-19 risk mitigation policies.","Oyenubi","COVID-19 risk perceptions and depressive symptoms in South Africa: Causal evidence in a longitudinal and nationally representative sample",2022,"the world bank microdata library at https://doi.org/10.25828/5z2w-7678 , reference number zaf_2020_nids-cram-w2_v01_m","serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is not understood how youth respond to a relationship stressor, which may impact trust, such as perceiving to be at risk for a sexually transmitted infection or their partner has other sex partners. We used a system science approach to examine feedback between trust and prorelationship behaviors within adolescent relationships. Methods: A prospective cohort of clinic-recruited young women (N = 122), aged 16-19 years, completed daily questionnaires on partner-specific feelings and risk perceptions for 18 months. Relationship stressor defined as either perceiving the risk of sexually transmitted infection from a partner or partner had other sex partners. Prorelationship behaviors were more time spent with partner, sex with partner, and/or gift from partner. Time-lagged generalized estimating equation models were used to examine whether a relationship stressor is associated with a decrease in trust and whether prorelationship behaviors changed following the stressor. Results: Experiencing a stressor was associated with threefold increased odds of having a decrease in trust in the same week (odds ratio [OR] = 3.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.30-4.72). Trust increased significantly the week following the stressor (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.54-2.85). An increase in trust relative to the week of the stressor was associated with a 65% increase in prorelationship behavior in the week following the stressor (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.20-2.26). Conclusions: Data uniquely show that trust is impacted following a relationship stressor and that youth increase prorelationship behaviors following a drop in trust. The findings suggest that adolescents prioritize maintaining trust, which may impact engagement in protective health behaviors. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The development of effective psychological interventions is needed. Worry and rumination are potential risk factors for the maintenance of insomnia, anxiety, and depression that may be modified by psychological treatment grounded in the Self-Regulatory Executive Function model. However, the relationships between worry, rumination, anxiety and depression, and insomnia are not known. Therefore, we investigated these relationships both cross-sectionally and longitudinally among patients with coronary heart disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study consecutively included 1,082 patients in 2014–2015, and 686 were followed up after mean of 4.7 years. Data were gathered from hospital records and self-report questionnaires comprising assessment of worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), rumination (Ruminative Responses Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and insomnia (Bergen Insomnia Scale). Results: Insomnia correlated moderately with all other psychological variables (R 0.18–0.50, all P values < .001). After adjustments for anxiety and depression, odds ratios for insomnia at baseline were 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.08–1.50) and 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.31–1.94) per 10 points increase of worry and rumination, respectively. Corresponding odds ratios for insomnia at follow-up were 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.05–1.55) and 1.38 (95% confidence interval 1.09–1.75). Depression was no longer significantly associated with insomnia after adjustments for worry and rumination, but anxiety remained significant. Conclusions: Worry and rumination predicted insomnia both cross-sectionally and prospectively, even after controlling for anxiety and depression, although anxiety remained significant.

During the early COVID-19 pandemic, the public responded psychologically to the threat posed by the pandemic, and frequently utilized media for information and entertainment. However, we lack a comprehensive picture of how perceived risk, emotion, stress, and media affected each other longitudinally during this time. Further, although response to the pandemic was highly politicized, research has yet to address how partisan affiliation moderated relationships between risk, emotion, stress, and media use over time. This three-wave (N = 1021) panel study assessed the interplay of risk, emotion, stress, and media use for Americans with different political affiliations between March and May of 2020. Findings indicate that perceived risk, emotion, and stress at Time 1 predicted media use at Time 2, with predictors varying by type of media. Use of entertainment media and social/mobile media predicted later stress (Time 3), but news consumption did not. Later risk perceptions (Time 3) were not influenced by media use at Time 2. The predictors and consequences of different types of media use were notably different for Republicans and Democrats. In particular, risk perceptions predicted greater news use among Democrats but greater entertainment media use among Republicans. Moreover, social/mobile media use resulted in perceiving the risks of COVID-19 as less serious for Republicans while increasing stress over time for Democrats.","Zhou","Perceived risk, emotions, and stress in response to COVID-19: The interplay of media use and partisanship",2022,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"19",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 158 women from high-risk breast cancer families completed self-report questionnaires at 2 weeks preconsultation and 4 weeks postconsultation. The consultations were audiotaped, transcribed and coded. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that discussing prophylactic mastectomy (P = 0.00) and oophorectomy (P = 0.01) led to women having significantly more expectations met; discussing genetic testing significantly decreased anxiety (P = 0.03) and facilitating understanding significantly decreased depression (P = 0,05).

The aim of this study is to explore the longitudinal trajectory of PrEP risk perception among men who have sex with men (MSM) and its impact on adherence. Methods: Data related to PrEP risk perception and adherence were derived from a prospective cohort study in Western China from 2013 to 2015. Subjects were categorized into the time-driven, event-driven and blank control groups. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was administered to subjects in the time-driven and event-driven groups, and all subjects were followed up every 12 weeks. The PrEP risk perception scale was constructed, and the growth mixture model (GMM) was used to classify longitudinal PrEP risk perception. The effect of different levels of PrEP risk perception on drug adherence was explored using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The PrEP risk perception scale consists of 4 dimensions and 16 items with Cronbach's alpha = 0.828 and a good model fit. According to the GMM analysis, the subjects' PrEP risk perceptions were separated into two groups: a high-risk perception group  (n = 133) and a low-risk perception group  (n = 493), where the proportion of high levels of drug adherence were 57.89% and 68.35%, respectively (p = 0.024). High levels of PrEP risk perception in the MSM population hinder drug adherence (RR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99, p = 0.046). The results of this study were validated in the subsequent PrEP projects conducted in 2019 to 2021. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that high levels of PrEP risk perception in the MSM population are an obstacle to drug adherence, emphasizing the necessity of focusing on PrEP risk perception in this population and the value of its application in the current context.","Lin","PrEP risk perception and adherence among men who have sex with men: a prospective cohort study based on growth mixture model",2022,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"8",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,84,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"homosexual",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china",NA,NA,NA,NA,626,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"29",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,"36",NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study is to quantitate the reciprocal associations between cannabis use and risk perception in a longitudinal panel of emerging adults. Design Observational study of longitudinal data from the Monitoring the Future longitudinal study using autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses to investigate reciprocal associations between cannabis risk perception and frequency of past-year cannabis use. Setting Surveys administered to 12th-grade students from the United States general population. Participants A total of 9929 12th-grade students (mean age 18.0 years) who were surveyed initially during 2000-05 and follow-up data until approximately 23-24 years old (three waves; n=9929). Measurements Perception of risk association with cannabis use and frequency of past-year cannabis use. Results At baseline, 33% of the 12th-graders used cannabis in the past year versus 28% by the third follow-up; 83% believed that smoking cannabis regularly carried moderate or great risk versus 78% by the third follow-up. All cross-lagged paths in both directions were statistically significant (all P<0.001), consistent with reciprocal influences between cannabis use and risk perception. The negative association between past-year cannabis use and subsequent risk perception (standardized coefficient range -0.21 to -0.27) was stronger than that between risk perception and subsequent use (standardized coefficient range -0.08 to -0.11; confidence intervals did not overlap with those for the coefficients reported above). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was limited to those who had never used cannabis prior to baseline.

We explore how perceptions of harmfulness and addictiveness of e-cigarettes influence e-cigarette initiation, and specifically whether this association varies by cigarette smoking status, in a longitudinal study of tobacco use on college campuses. Methods: Data are from a 5-wave 24-college study in Texas. Only students who reported never using e-cigarettes at wave 1 were included (n = 2565). Multilevel discrete-time hazard models, accounting for school clustering, were used. The dependent variable, ever e-cigarette use, was assessed at each wave. Both time-varying (e cigarette perceptions of harmfulness and addictiveness, age, use of cigarettes, use of other tobacco products, and use of other substances) and time-invariant demographic covariates were included. Two-way interactions between each e-cigarette perception variable and current conventional cigarette use were tested to determine if the hypothesized relationship differed among smokers and non-smokers. Results: 21% of all never e-cigarette users at baseline had initiated e-cigarette ever use by wave 5. Significant two-way interactions qualified the relationship between risk perceptions and e-cigarette initiation. Specifically, perceptions of a lower degree of harmfulness (OR = 1.13, p =.047) and addictiveness (OR = 1.34,p < .001) of e-cigarettes predicted initiation among non-smokers, but not among current smokers. Conclusion: Perceiving a lower degree of risk of e-cigarettes contributes to subsequent e-cigarette initiation among non-smokers, but not among current smokers.

A series of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were undertaken to assess the reliability, stability and validity of the measure. Patients with psoriasis from four samples (consecutive attendees, anxious patients, depressed patients, and 6-month follow-up of consecutive attendees) completed the PSWQ and measures assessing related constructs of anxiety and depression (HADS) and coping (COPE). The clinical severity of patient's psoriasis was also assessed by dermatologists using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Exploratory factor analysis was undertaken and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to examine the clinical utility of the PSWQ cut-off score for normal and pathological worry. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that the PSWQ is essentially unidimensional in patients with psoriasis. Intraclass correlation demonstrated that, over a 6-month period, the reproducibility of the PSWQ total scale was good in patients with anxiety and moderate in patients with depression. ROC analysis suggested that the optimum cutoff differentiating pathological worry was &GT; 60, which is commensurate with findings in adult mental health more generally. The PSWQ cutoff for pathological worry showed a lower specificity for depression than anxiety. The PSWQ is an appropriate measure of pathological worry in patients with psoriasis. The cutoff on the scale for pathological worry demonstrates appropriate conceptual overlap with subordinate distress categories of anxiety and depression.","Fortune","Worry and Pathological Worry in Patients with Psoriasis: Cross Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) in Four Samples of Patients",2005,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.78",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"clinical/patients",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"uk",NA,NA,NA,NA,100,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.44,NA,NA,NA,NA,"43.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,13.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stability of public perceptions is important for policy-makers; only if public attitudes and perceptions remain constant, policy-makers will be able to take them into account. The aim of the present study was to examine the stability of participants' risk and benefit perceptions of gene technology over a period of two years. In spring, 2008 and in spring, 2010, the same sample of participants filled out an identical questionnaire. Results of structural equation modelling show that risk and benefit perceptions of gene technology applications are moderately stable (r=.5-.7). Furthermore, results show that people distinguish between medical, plant and food applications and applications involving animals when evaluating the risk of gene technology. When evaluating the benefits, participants also take consumer-related benefits into account, such as enhancement of functional properties. Results of the present study suggest that risk research should regularly examine people's risk perceptions in order to gain a clearer picture of the dynamics of people's perception and preferences not only of novel technologies, but also of entrenched technologies.","Conner","The stability of risk and benefit perceptions: a longitudinal study assessing the perception of biotechnology",2016,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: gene technology",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.49","0.59",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,730,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,534,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.42,NA,NA,NA,NA,"57",NA,NA,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has demonstrated that many women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) overestimate their risk for future breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and soon thereafter. This study aims to evaluate risk perceptions after 5 years. Patients and Methods. In a longitudinal cohort study, we mailed long-term follow-up surveys to 315 women who had previously responded to a survey 18 months after they were diagnosed with DCIS, excluding those who had experienced recurrence and those not treated at our institution. We evaluated risk perceptions with items used previously in the cohort. Results. One hundred ninety-three women (61%) responded. The median time since diagnosis was 5.9 years. We excluded 12 because of recurrence. Of the 181 remaining, 32% perceived at least a moderate 5-year risk for developing DCIS again, 43% perceived at least a moderate lifetime risk for developing DCIS again, 27% perceived at least a moderate 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer, 38% perceived at least a moderate lifetime risk for invasive breast cancer, and 24% perceived at least a moderate risk for DCIS spreading to other body parts. In a multivariate model, worse financial status and higher perceived risk in the previous survey were the only predictors of at least a moderate perception of risk for DCIS spreading. Conclusion. Women with a history of DCIS continue to harbor in accurate perceptions of their risk for future breast cancer events even 5 years after diagnosis.

Young adults not meeting criteria for subclinical, or analogue Generalized Anxiety Disorder (AGAD) were randomized to an eight-week RET intervention, or eight-week wait-list. AGAD status was determined using validated cut-scores for both the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire-Generalized Anxiety Disorder subscale (>= 6) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (>= 45). The primary outcome was anxiety symptoms measured with the Trait Anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The RET was designed according to World Health Organization and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. RM-ANCOVA examined differences between RET and wait-list over time. Significant interactions were decomposed with simple effects analysis. Hedges' d effect sizes quantified magnitude of differences in change between RET and wait-list. Twenty-eight participants (64% female) fully engaged in the trial (mean age: 26.06.2y, RET: n=14; Wait-list: n=14).

However, there is limited evidence for assumed causal relationships between risk perception and prevention behaviour and the degree to which change in behaviour is attributable to change in risk perception is poorly understood. This study examines longitudinal relationships between changes in HIV risk perception and in condom use and the public health importance of changing risk perception. Methods Data on sexually active, HIV-negative adults (15-54 years) were taken from four surveys of a general-population open-cohort study in Manicaland, Zimbabwe (2003-2013). Increasing condom use between surveys was modelled in generalised estimating equations dependent on change in risk perception between surveys. Accounting for changes in other socio-demographic and behavioural factors, regression models examined the bi-directional relationship between risk perception and condom use, testing whether increasing risk perception is associated with increasing condom use and whether increasing condom use is associated with decreasing risk perception. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated. Results One thousand, nine hundred eighty-eight males and 3715 females participated in >= 2 surveys, contributing 8426 surveys pairs. Increasing risk perception between two surveys was associated with higher odds of increasing condom use (males: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85-2.28, PAF = 3.39%; females: aOR = 1.41 [1.06-1.88], PAF = 6.59%), adjusting for changes in other socio-demographic and behavioural factors. Those who decreased risk perception were also more likely to increase condom use (males: aOR = 1.76 [1.12-2.78]; females: aOR = 1.23 [0.93-1.62]) compared to those without change in risk perception. Conclusions Results on associations between changing risk perception and increasing condom use support hypothesised effects of risk perception on condom use and effects of condom use on risk perception (down-adjusting risk perception after adopting condom use). However, low proportions of change in condom use were attributable to changing risk perception, underlining the range of factors influencing HIV prevention behaviour and the need for comprehensive approaches to HIV prevention.","Schaefer","Relationships between changes in HIV risk perception and condom use in East Zimbabwe 2003–2013: population-based longitudinal analyses",2020,"http://www.manicalandhivproject.org/data.html","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; health catastrophe; other: hiv",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Two online surveys were distributed to hospital staff in seven countries (Germany, Andorra, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Romania, Iran) between May and October 2020 (T1) and between February and April 2021 (T2), using the following variables: Burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), job function, age, gender, and contact with COVID-19 patients; individual resources (self-compassion, sense of coherence, social support) and work-related resources and demands (support at the workplace, risk perception, health and safety at the workplace, altruistic acceptance of risk). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models repeated measures, controlled for age. Results: A total of 612 respondents were included (76% women). We found an increase in burnout from T1 to T2. Burnout was high among personnel with high contact with COVID-19 patients. Individual factors (selfcompassion, sense of coherence) and work-related factors (support at the workplace, risk perception, health and safety at the workplace) showed associations with burnout. Low health and safety at the workplace at T1 was associated with an increase in emotional exhaustion at T2. Men showed an increase in depersonalization if they had much contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Burnout represents a potential problematic consequence of occupational contact with COVID-19 patients. Special attention should be paid to this group in organizational health management. Selfcompassion, sense of coherence, support at the workplace, risk perception, and health and safety at the workplace may be important starting points for interventions.

This study aimed to verify the relationship among meaning in life (MIL), epidemic risk perception, health locus of control (HLC), and preventive health behaviors among older adults after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic. Method In this longitudinal study, 164 participants aged 55 years and above completed the following measures at time 1 (February 19, 2021) and one month later at time 2 (March 19, 2021): Meaning in Life in the Epidemic Questionnaire, Epidemic Risk Perception Questionnaire, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and Health Behaviors Before and After the Epidemic Survey. Hayes' SPSS Process Macro was used to analyze the mediating effect of epidemic risk perception (model 4) and the moderating role of powerful others HLC in the mediation model (model 14). Results The results showed that after controlling for gender, age, education level, and health behaviors at the baseline, risk perception had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between MIL and preventive health behaviors (beta = .02, SE = .01, 95% CI [.00, .04]). In addition, powerful others HLC had a moderating effect on the second half of the mediating effect (beta = .02, p = .02, 95% CI [.00, .03]). Specifically, compared to the older adults with low powerful others HLC, the risk perception of older adults with high powerful others HLC increased preventive health behaviors. Conclusion Practitioners should adequately cultivate older adults' risk awareness and reinforce the importance of advice from doctors and professionals, thereby effectively enhancing the preventive health behaviors of older adults in China during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nie","The Relationship Between Meaning in Life and Health Behaviors in Adults Aged 55 Years and Over During the COVID‑19 Pandemic: the Mediating Role of Risk Perception and the Moderating Role of Powerful Others Health Locus of Control",2022,"osf.io/4cs6y","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"15",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: health behaviors",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Declining opportunities for youth to acquire food-handling knowledge and skills increases their risk of contracting a foodborne illness. Many youths are employed in food service and could perpetuate the spread of foodborne illness. In this study, two food safety curricula were evaluated for effectiveness in changing the food safety knowledge, risk-perception, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) of high school students enrolled in microbiology and agriculture courses, immediately following and one year after an educational intervention. One curriculum utilized the Positive Deviance (PD) model, while the other utilized Experiential Learning (EL) methods. Survey questions related to risk-perception and PCB were measured on a five-point Likert scale. Twenty-four knowledge questions were assigned one point for each correct answer and zero points for incorrect answers. Risk-perception and PBC continued to increase from the post-survey to the follow-up survey among the PD and EL Groups. After the educational intervention, the EL Group perceived themselves to be at a greater risk for contracting a foodborne illness and became significantly more confident in their abilities to clean food-contact surfaces, store food safely, and prepare food that is safe to eat. Knowledge scores also significantly increased among the PD (16.88-18.78) and EL (16.66-18.81) Groups.

Design Prospective and longitudinal. Setting United States. Participants A total of 237 adult smokers (mean age 56 years) receiving medical care from home health-care nurses. Participants did not have to want to quit smoking to participate, but received cessation counseling within the context of their medical care. Measurements Three measures of risk perception were given pre- and post-treatment: perceived vulnerability, optimistic bias and precaution effectiveness. Smoking status was verified biochemically at end of treatment and at 2, 6 and 12 months later. Findings Principal components analysis supported the theoretical discriminability of the risk perception measures, and intercorrelations provided evidence for concurrent and predictive validity. Elevated risk perception was associated with a variety of socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Optimistic bias was associated significantly with older age and ethnic minority status. Smokers in pre-contemplation had lower perceived vulnerability and precaution effectiveness and greater optimistic bias than those in contemplation and preparation. Smokers in preparation had higher perceived vulnerability and lower optimistic bias than those in earlier stages. Change in perceived vulnerability predicted smoking cessation at follow-up. Optimistic bias predicted a lower likelihood of cessation and precaution effectiveness predicted a greater likelihood of smoking cessation, but only among those with a smoking-related illness. Conclusions In patients receiving medical care from home health-care nurses, change in perceived vulnerability to smoking-related disease is predictive of smoking cessation. In those with smoking-related illnesses, optimistic bias predicts continued smoking while precaution effectiveness predicts cessation.","Borrelli","Risk perception and smoking behavior in medically ill

We sought to evaluate longitudinal trends in people's risk perceptions and vaccination intentions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Methods. We used data from 10 waves of a US national survey focusing on the H1N1 pandemic (administered between May 2009 and January 2010) to conduct a longitudinal analysis of adult respondents' risk perceptions and vaccination intentions. Results. Self-reported perceived risk of becoming infected with H1N1 paralleled H1N1 activity throughout the pandemic's first year. However, intention to be vaccinated declined from 50% (May 2009) to 16% (January 2010) among those who remained unvaccinated (27% had been vaccinated by January 2010). Respondents who indicated that they had previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza reported significantly higher H1N1 vaccination intentions than those who had not been vaccinated (67% vs 26%; P<.001). Conclusions. Reported intention to be vaccinated declined well before vaccine became available and decreased throughout the pandemic year. To the extent that prior vaccination for seasonal influenza vaccination is a strong correlate of H1N1 risk perceptions, encouraging seasonal influenza vaccination may benefit pandemic preparedness efforts.

This investigation aimed to longitudinally evaluate food procurement patterns, concern of virus exposure in grocery retailers, and food access challenges over the pandemic among a sample of households in Quebec, Canada. MethodsOnline surveys were collected at three time points of the pandemic: first wave in spring 2020 (lockdown period), summer 2020 (deconfinement period), and second wave in winter 2021 (curfew period). Respondents were the household's primary grocery shopper (n = 491). Non-parametric tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to compare responses over time and to evaluate characteristics of respondents who regularly used no-contact grocery methods (store pick-up or home delivery). ResultsFrequency of in-store grocery shopping was lowest during the lockdown (once per week or less), and significantly increased over time to resemble pre-pandemic frequency. Concern of virus exposure in grocery retailers and disinfection/discarding of food packaging was highest during the lockdown, but significantly decreased over time. At all time points, use of public transit, walking or cycling for grocery shopping was associated with regular use of no-contact grocery methods (curfew odds ratio (OR): 3.13 (95% confidence interval 1.60, 6.14). Age (60 years+) was associated with regular use during the lockdown [OR: 2.27 (1.13, 4.59)]. ConclusionAmong our sample, frequency of in-store grocery shopping was lowest and concern of virus exposure in stores was highest during the lockdown period. No-contact grocery use was associated with transportation mode and potentially with personal risk perception (age).","Nielsen","Longitudinal Patterns of Food Procurement Over of the Course of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From a Canadian Online Household Survey",2022,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"household’s primary

We observed more polarization with greater ability in emotional responses, risk perceptions, and product-purchase intentions across five waves of data collection with a diverse, convenience sample from February 2020 through July 2020 (Study 1, N = 1267). Specifically, more liberal participants had more negative emotional responses and greater risk perceptions of COVID-19 than conservative participants. Compared to conservatives, liberal participants also interpreted quantitative information as indicating higher COVID-19 risk and sought COVID-related news more from liberal than conservative news media. Of key importance, we also compared verbal and numeric cognitive abilities for their independent capacity to predict greater polarization. Although measures of numeric ability, such as objective numeracy, are often used to index ability-related polarization, ideological differences were more pronounced among those higher in verbal ability specifically. Similar results emerged in secondary analysis of risk perceptions in a nationally representative longitudinal dataset (Study 2, N = 4494; emotions and purchase intentions were not included in this dataset). We further confirmed verbal-ability-related polarization findings on non-COVID policy attitudes (i.e., weapons bans and Medicare-for-all) measured cross-sectionally. The present Study 2 documented ability-related polarization emerging over time for the first time (rather than simply measuring polarization in existing beliefs). Both studies demonstrated verbal ability measures as the most robust predictors of ability-related polarization. Together, these results suggest that polarization may be a function of the amount and/or application of verbal knowledge rather than selective application of quantitative reasoning skills.","Shoots-Reinhard","Ability-related political polarization in the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"wave 1: https://osf.io/qu8bp/?view_only=cf126f09578e44c9b6abee49b6e72b5a

Peoples' climate risk perceptions are mediated by their connections to local environment, observations of environmental change and personal weather experiences. A longitudinal study randomly sampled 1,162 Hunter Valley coastal and rural residents in New South Wales. Telephone interviewers (2008) recruited lakeside homeowners 'at risk' of sea level rise, nearby 'control' residents and a comparable farming area group. Follow-up interviews (2011) located 81.5 % of the original sample. Fifty-six items based on the model asked about climate change observations, concerns, impacts and actions. Statistically significant rural-suburban and time differences were found. The rural sample was attuned to conditions affecting agricultural productivity: They worried about drought and heat, saw trees dying and changes to seasons and natural rhythms. They anticipate the impact of water scarcity, conserve water and value protecting plants and animals. Compared to higher elevation residents, lake dwellers observed marine life loss, worry about sea level rise and predict the decline of property values. Across time, all groups' perceptions of warming indicators declined. Concerns and impacts were high and generally stayed high, as did actions related to energy use. No differences emerged in beliefs about climate warming. Climate change observations, along with concerns and actions, have important implications for the environmental cognitive stress model. Overall, dynamic changes in residents' understandings are related to a changing policy environment, the vicissitudes of climate debates and weather experiences, including extreme swings from inundation to drought.","Higginbotham","Subregional differences in Australian climate risk perceptions: coastal versus agricultural areas of the Hunter Valley, NSW",2014,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"13",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"natural catastrophe; other: climate change",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,840,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"hunter valley residents",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,1162,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.6,NA,NA,NA,NA,"55",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For boreal agriculture, climate change might also bring opportunities as the growing season lengthens, if the risks of climate change are managed properly. Agricultural production is a source of greenhouse gases, while agricultural land has also a great possibility to mitigate climate change as a carbon sink. Farmers are the central group for implementing these actions. Their views and beliefs contribute to their corresponding pro-environmental agricultural behavior. This research is based on the theory of value-belief-norm (VBN) as a predictive model of pro-environmental agricultural behavior. We extend the theory by studying how opportunities caused by climate change affect pro-environmental behavior in agriculture and present differences between farmer groups and experiment with the longitudinal possibilities of the theoretical model. Based on the structured survey responses from 4,401 farmers in Finland in 2018 and 2000 responses in 2020, we found that all the elements of VBN theory did help to predict intention for climate change mitigation, among which felt possibility to perform mitigation practices was the strongest predictor while risk perception was rather an unimportant one. Furthermore, opportunities caused directly or indirectly by climate change have an effect on Finnish farmer's implementation of mitigation practices. Therefore, future efforts in agricultural research and policy in Finland should concentrate to bring forth concrete farm-level mitigation practices with proven environmental benefits and the direct and indirect opportunities should be given more attention.","Sorvali","Climate change opportunities reduce farmers' risk perception: Extension of the value-belief-norm theory in the context of Finnish agriculture",2022,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"other: climate change and agriculture",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: The peer intervention was implemented during the first week of September 2000 in Lusaka, Zambia. A quasi-experimental, longitudinal panel design was used to evaluate its impact. Three schools were randomly assigned to the intervention condition and two to the control condition. Three rounds of data from male and female adolescents in grades 10 and 11 were collected at baseline in July 2000, at first follow-up in the second half of September 2000, and at second follow-up in early April 2001. A total of 416 respondents aged 14-23 (at baseline) were interviewed in all three survey rounds. A mixed-effects logistic regression growth curve analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios to compare intervention and control groups on the outcome variables. Results: Student self-reports showed positive changes in normative beliefs about abstinence immediately after the intervention, and these improvements were largely sustained until 6 months after the intervention. Students became more likely to approve of condom use and to intend using condoms immediately after the intervention, but these positive outcomes could not be sustained during the 6 months that followed the intervention. Normative beliefs regarding condom use took longer to develop: these were only observed at 6 months follow-up. Students reported reductions in multiple regular partnerships. There was no change in condom use. Conclusions: A single session school-based peer sexual health intervention resulted in the development of normative beliefs about abstinence that were sustained over a 6-month period. Normative beliefs about condoms took longer to develop. More regular efforts may be required to sustain the approval of, and the intention to use, condoms.

Purpose: To test the effectiveness of a partially tailored mailed intervention based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model, delivered in the spring over 3 years to parents and children. Design: RCT, with data collection through telephone interviews of parents and skin exams of children at baseline (Summer 2004) and annually (Summer 2005-2007). The control group received no intervention. Setting/participants: Families recruited in the Denver CO area, through private pediatric clinics, a large MCO, and community settings. Children born in 1998 were approximately 6 years of age at baseline; 867 children met inclusion criteria; analysis is reported for 677 white, non-Hispanic participants at highest risk for skin cancer. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were parent-reported child sun protection behaviors. Secondary outcomes included parents' risk perception, perceived effectiveness of and barriers to prevention behaviors, stage of change, reported sunburns, and observed tanning and nevus development. The longitudinal mixed-model analysis was conducted between 2008 and 2011. Results: The intervention group reported more use of sunscreen, protective clothing, hats, shade-seeking, and midday sun avoidance; fewer sunburns; more awareness of the risk of skin cancer; higher perceived effectiveness of sun protection; higher stage of change; and lower perception of barriers to sun protection (all p<0.05). The intervention group had fewer nevi >= 2 mm in in 1 year of the study, 2006 (p = 0.03). No differences were found in tanning or nevi <2 mm. Conclusions: The level of behavior change associated with this single-modality intervention is not likely sufficient to reduce skin cancer risk. However, the intervention shows promise for inclusion in longer-term, multicomponent interventions that have sufficient intensity to affect skin cancer incidence.","Crane","Mailed Intervention to Promote Sun Protection of Children",2012,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA,NA,NA,NA,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: sun protection",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article extends the Bayesian risk updating model developed by Anwar and Loughran (2011) to determine whether the weight individuals place on new offending information differs across persons on the basis of individual characteristics. Using longitudinal data from a sample of serious youthful offenders, we found that the effect of an arrest on updated risk perceptions differs as a function of IQ and early behavioral problems. In particular, individuals low in verbal IQ and those who display early behavioral problems place greater weight on new information, suggesting that individuals who are traditionally viewed as being high in criminal propensity are more affected by arrest such that they are more likely to increase their perceived risk of getting caught when offending after experiencing an arrest. Findings support the idea that high-propensity offenders are more responsive to formal sanctions, and thus (potentially) more deterrable, than low-propensity individuals.","Thomas","Do Individual Characteristics Explain Variation in Sanction Risk Updating Among Serious Juvenile Offenders?

This study used a mixed-method qualitative-quantitative approach to assess consumer risk perception and trusted sources of food safety information during the pandemic. From April to August of 2020, five waves of online surveys (N = 3,584, with a minimum of 700 per month) were distributed to a U.S. consumer panel, which included only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups recruited participants (N = 43) from the first wave of survey respondents and were conducted via Webex from May to July 2020. Topics covered in both studies focused on food safety risk perceptions and trusted sources of information during the pandemic. Trusted sources of information included government agencies, healthcare professionals, scientists, and social media. Throughout the longitudinal study, survey respondents and focus group participants perceived a higher risk of getting COVID-19 from people than from food. Survey respondents believed that handwashing could protect them more from COVID-19 than from foodborne illnesses. Many focus group participants practiced handwashing to prevent them from contracting COVID-19 from food items. Both survey respondents and focus group participants trusted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and healthcare professionals for COVID-19 and food safety information. Focus group participants trusted these entities because they provide information that is scientifically proven. Survey data for all five months reported social media to be the least-trusted source of both COVID19 and food safety information. Focus group participants agreed that social media has misinformation. The findings suggest that increased risk perception may have caused consumers to adopt good hand hygiene. However, consumers may not be connecting such practices to food safety. Food safety educators can use this time of heightened risk perception to connect COVID-19 and food safety practices. Trusted entities of information also need to be aware of their impact on consumer behavior and provide consumers with proper food safety information.","Thomas","Consumer risk perception and trusted sources of food safety information during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA,NA,NA,NA,"19",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; other: food safety",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,3584,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.48,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The survey dataset showed a dramatic increase in willingness to purchase, from 36.9% in 2008 to 76.1% in 2019. Analysis of the datasets identified changes in the effects of the variables over a decade. The analysis indicated that people who perceived a low level of BSE risk, males, and supporters of conservative parties were more likely to buy the US beef. In 2008, the most important determinant of US beef purchase intentions was risk perception. In 2015, after the widespread panic subsided, while there remained effects of perceived BSE risk, it was moderated by political propensity. Personal political ideology was used as a heuristic in the purchasing behavior of those who doubted the safety of US beef. Finally, the data in 2019 showed decreased effects of both risk perception and political propensity, as more than three quarters of respondents stated that they would buy US beef.

Using a survey instrument targeting young adults, which we repeated during the second and fourth waves of COVID-19, we explored how various psychological factors affect risk perception and to what degree can these be linked to COVID skepticism. Our results suggest that higher skepticism is very strongly associated with a lower risk perception. Skepticism also mediates the effects of well-known antecedents of risk perception, such as individualism, pro-social attitudes and trust in scientists. We found that contracting the virus is associated with increased risk perception and increased skepticism, which is contradictory, but understandable considering our sample composition. Among those who had a family member or a friend contracting the virus we observed higher levels of perceived risk and lower skepticism. The longitudinal nature of our research highlights that the influence of trust in scientists and government are dependent on the public discourse, which naturally develops over time. Differences in risk perception based on gender, which is well established in the literature and significant in our first sample, have diminished by the time of our second sample, suggesting this effect could be crowded out as people's understanding grows and beliefs form about the virus.

Objective: In this study, we took advantage of a large epidemic of chikungunya, an emerging mosquito-borne disease, in French Guiana to examine the dynamic interaction between risk-related perceptions and behaviours that occurs in response to a disease outbreak. In particular, we tested empirically the assumption that both risk perceptions and health behaviours were elastic with respect to prevalence of chikungunya. Methods: A representative sample of French Guianan (N=434) was interviewed in January 2015 just after the peak of the epidemic, and again 2 months later. Participants were asked about their perceptions of the threat, as well as their engagement in a range of protective behaviours promoted by the regional health authorities to control the spread of the disease. Results: The surveys showed that (1) the frequency of some health behaviours- those related to visible control methods - significantly increased with the subjective and objective prevalence of the disease, (2) perceived risk of infection for oneself tended to decrease considerably over time, and (3) the risk reappraisal hypothesis failed to account for this paradoxical trend in the peoples response to the risk of contracting the disease. Conclusion These findings suggest that people may fail to adjust their risk perceptions, and to a lesser extent their health protective behaviours, to the course of an epidemic. Notably, the prevalence elasticity of preventive action found in previous studies of behavioural response to infectious diseases differed substantially according to the type of intervention (personal versus environmental methods). This paradoxical trend may be attributed to risk habituation effects, which seem to vary significantly according to the social visibility of thepreventive actions.","Raude","Understanding health behaviour changes in response to outbreaks: Findings from a longitudinal study of a large epidemic of mosquito-borne disease",2019,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: mosquito-borne",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"french guiana",NA,NA,NA,NA,434,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.49,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Four waves of surveys took place before and four after the incinerator started working, including the assessment of psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression and stress), risk perception, attitudes towards the incinerator and environmental annoyance. Results show that (i) risk perception is more acute for residents living closer to the site, who also have a less favourable attitude; (ii) there is an habituation effect for those living closer to the incinerator: they now have less extreme attitudes and a lower estimation of risk; (iii) psychological symptoms are associated with socio-economic variables (sex and education), but also with environmental annoyance; (iv) for those living close to the site, risk perception and the interaction between risk perception and environmental annoyance significantly increase the prediction of psychological symptoms.

Risk perception helps to understand how rheumatoid arthritis patients perceive disease-related-risks. We developed and validated a risk perception questionnaire for Spanish speaking rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods The questionnaire development and validation was performed in 3 steps, using respective convenience samples. Step-1 included the conceptual model construction, 20 patient's interviews to identify components from the conceptual model-dimensions and 11 healthcare provider's consultations who identified RA related manifestations/complications (network and frequencies analysis). Step-2 consisted of item generation and reduction and questionnaire feasibility (n = 100). Step-3 consisted of the questionnaire psychometric validation (n = 270), which included content, face, construct (exploratory factor analysis) and criterion validity (logistic regression analysis) and consistency and stability (Cronbach's a and test-retest). Results Samples were representative of typical RA outpatients. Initial conceptual model included 7 dimensions, 3 for probability and 1 each, for responsibility, prevention, control and for severity (Step-1). The final version was considered feasible by the patients and included 27 items (Step-2). A five-factor model was most appropriated and resulted in 68.8% of the variance explained: Cronbach's alpha = 0.90, intraclass-correlation-coefficient = 0.93 (95% CI = 0.90-0.95). A positive relation between number of external criteria from the charts and risk perception was found; all items had >= 80% agreement from experts; patients agreed about item's semantic clarity (89%) and format adequacy (97%), (Step-3).

It is unclear whether this new approval has lowered the risk perception of recreational ketamine use. This is important given a recent increase in recreational ketamine use.Methods: This study expanded on an existing longitudinal online study of the nightlife scene, by adding an additional longitudinal assessment as well as a new cross-sectional sample. Participants had to be aged 18-34 years, reside in the UK and have attended at least 6 electronic music events in the past year. The likelihood of increasing recreational ketamine use due to the approval, attitudes towards and risk perception of medical ketamine use and experiences resulting from recreational ketamine use were collected after the approval. Changes in ketamine use and frequency were assessed longitudinally before and after the approval.Results: The overall sample size was 2415: 414 longitudinal (57% retention rate) and 2001 new cross-sectional participants. The majority indicated no change in their likelihood of using recreational ketamine due to the approval of esketamine (87%). Longitudinal participants did not indicate an increase in past 12 month use or frequency after the approval. Only one-third of participants reported being aware of the approval. Participants previously aware showed greater overall support for medical use of ketamine than participants previously unaware of the change. However, an equally high risk was assigned to the recreational use of ketamine in both groups. Ketamine users indicated both increases as well as decreases in depression and anxiety as a result of ketamine use.Conclusion: The introduction of esketamine as an antidepressant was not associated with a change in the risk perception of recreational ketamine use in most participants, nor was it longitudinally associated with increased use. Potential negative effects of recreational ketamine use on mental health, as users in this sample reported, should be clearly communicated when discussing the benefits of (es-) ketamine in a therapeutic context.","Grabski","Is approving esketamine as an antidepressant for treatment resistant depression associated with recreational use and risk perception of ketamine?

Second, to investigate metacognitive predictors of pathological worry and obsessive-compulsive (o-c) symptoms in this group. The sample included 561 non-clinical participants. Consistent with non-English versions, the Turkish version of the PSWQ was found to have a two-factor structure. The MCQ-30 was shown to be composed of five factors similar to the English version. Reliability analyses indicated that both the PSWQ and MCQ-30 possessed high internal consistency, split-half reliability and test-retest coefficients. As expected, both scales positively correlated with measures of o-c symptoms, trait anxiety, and anxiety and depression, as well as with each other. Negative and positive metacognitive beliefs about worry were significant predictors of both pathological worry and o-c symptoms.

However, no pregnancy-specific model has been developed or tested in the context of health behaviour change during pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate and compare the utility of the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) and Teachable Moments (TM) models, to explain health behaviour change during pregnancy, within the context of eating behaviour. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Methods Five hundred and sixteen women completed a survey at between 12-16 weeks gestation (T1). Follow-up data were collected at 20-24 weeks (T2), 36-40 weeks (T3), and 6-12 weeks postnatally (T4). The primary outcome was eating behaviour. To assess the utility of the COM-B model, perceived capability, opportunity, and motivation to eat healthily were measured. To assess the utility of the TM model, risk perceptions, self-image, and affective response were measured. Results Overall, the COM-B model explained 18.4% of the variance in eating behaviour, whilst the TM model explained 9%. Both models explained the most variance in eating behaviour at T1 and T3, compared with T2 and T4. Small changes were observed in eating behaviour and the model constructs over the time period studied, although these were not clinically meaningful. Conclusions Neither the COM-B nor TM model provide a satisfactory explanation of eating behaviour during pregnancy, however the findings suggest that certain stages of pregnancy may create more salient opportunities for behaviour change. The findings also support claims that motivation may not play a key role in directing eating behaviour during pregnancy. Further research is needed to explore the role of timing in antenatal behaviour change. The development of a pregnancy-specific model is necessary to optimise understanding of pregnancy as a teachable moment for behaviour change.","Rockliffe","Investigating the utility of the COM-B and TM model to explain changes in eating behaviour during pregnancy: A longitudinal cohort study",2022,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk","worry",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",4,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"health; other: pregnancy",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference","mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant","significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,107.31,107.31,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,"only female","only female",NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"uk","uk",NA,NA,NA,516,516,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"30",30,NA,NA,NA,4.8,4.8,NA,NA,NA,18,18,NA,NA,NA,"45",45,NA,NA,NA

An earlier longitudinal panel study of Americans' views on Ebola risk inspired this partial replication on Americans' views of Zika risks, using multilevel modeling to assess temporal changes in these views and inter-individual factors affecting them, and to determine if similar factors were influential for both non-epidemics in the USA. Baseline Zika risk scores - as in the Ebola study - were influenced by dread of the Zika virus, perceptions of a near-miss outbreak, and perceived likelihood of an outbreak. Judgments of both personal risk and national risk from Zika declined significantly, and individual rates of news following predicted slower decline of perceived national risk in both cases. However, few other factors affected changes in Zika risk judgments, which did not replicate in a validation half-sample, whereas several factors slowed or increased the rate of decline in Ebola judgments of the U.S. risk. These differences might reflect differences in the diseases caused by these two viruses - e.g., Ebola's much greater lethality - but more longitudinal studies across multiple diseases will be needed to test that speculation. Benefits of such studies to health risk analysis outweigh the difficulties they pose.","Johnson","Temporal shifts in Americans' risk perceptions of the Zika outbreak",2020,"decision research online panel","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: zika",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,370,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.514,NA,NA,NA,NA,"47.3",NA,NA,NA,NA,18.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, these measures only work if they are generally accepted by the public. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey in Switzerland (n = 1,223) to study the factors that would influence perceived risks and the acceptance of the measures. Our findings showed that people with individualistic worldviews, high general interpersonal trust, low social trust, a low level of perceived risks, and the conviction that risks other than health risks were neglected had less acceptance of the implemented measures compared with people who held the opposite views on the mentioned variables. The number of infected people declined between survey waves 1 and 2. This desired effect not only reduced people's perceived risks but also decreased their social trust and increased the conviction that other risks were neglected. Finally, the acceptance of the measures declined. Our data also support the idea that reduced risk perceptions and a decline in social trust are important drivers for the reduction in the acceptance of the measures in survey wave 2. Our results suggest that as soon as the measures attain success or the public is tired of the implemented restrictions, public acceptance declines, and it seems difficult to prolong the measures as may be desirable from an epidemiological standpoint. The importance of worldviews and trust for public acceptance of the measures further suggests the necessity of a political discussion about the implemented measures.","Siegrist","Worldviews, trust, and risk perceptions shape public

Despite increasing attentions on the temporal dimension of risk perception and behavior in recent literature, the dynamic relationships between these two constructs remain understudied. Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, provide a key setting for analyzing evolving perceptions of and responses to natural or human-induced hazards. The main objectives of this research are: (1) to assess temporal changes in cognitive and affective dimensions of perceived COVID-19 risk as well as related protective behavior; and (2) to explore the dynamic relationships between COVID-19 risk perception and behavioral responses. Timely data on changing risk perception and behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak were collected through two series of online surveys from four major cities (Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City; N = 736) and the central Midwest region of the United States (N = 1240) respectively during March-August 2020. The analysis revealed that: (1) the cognitive and affective dimensions of perceived COVID-19 risk and preventive behavior all changed over time; (2) there were both within- and across-time correlations between COVID-19 risk perception indicators and preventive actions; and (3) preventive actions showed varied feedback effects on individual aspects of perceived COVID-19 risk over time. Findings from this research support and expand major conceptual approaches to changing relationships between risk perception and behavior, particularly the risk reappraisal hypothesis.

AGAD status was determined using validated cutscores for both the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire-GAD subscale (>= 6) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (>= 45). Remission, based on change in AGAD status, was assessed post-intervention, and quantified with number needed to treat (NNT). Primary analyses focused on participants missing outcome data at <= 1 time point (RET: n=12, Wait-list: n=15). RM-ANCOVA examined differences between RET and wait-list across time. Simple effects analysis decomposed significant interactions. Hedges' d quantified magnitude of differences in change between conditions over time. Results: Attendance was 81% and compliance to the RET was 77%. Participants significantly increased strength (all d >= 1.24, p <= 0.006) with no adverse events. RET improved AGAD status (NNT=3, 95%CI: 2 to 7). Significant group X time interactions were found for worry (F-(3,F-66) = 3.12, p <= 0.043; d=0.93, 95%CI: 0.13 to 1.73) and anxiety symptoms (F-(3,F-57.84)=2.91, epsilon=0.88, p <= 0.045; d=0.71, 95%CI: -0.08 to 1.49). RET significantly reduced worry (mean difference=-6.49, p <= 0.045) and anxiety symptoms (mean difference=-10.50, p <= 0.001). Limitations: Limitations include a small sample size, and lack of attention-matched control condition. Conclusion: RET significantly improved AGAD severity, and elicited large, clinically meaningful improvements in worry and anxiety symptoms among young adults with AGAD.","Gordon","Resistance exercise training among young adults with analogue generalized anxiety disorder",2021,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: exercise and anxiety disorder",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"patient",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ireland",NA,NA,NA,NA,44,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.66,NA,NA,NA,NA,"25.4",NA,NA,NA,NA,4.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adolescents completed self-reports annually for 3 years (N = 893; M-age = 12.30 years, 10-14 years at Wave 1, and 10-17 years across the full study period; 50% girls, 33% White non-Latinx, 27% Latinx, 20% African American, 20% mixed/other race). The association between social risk tolerance and prosocial tendencies changed significantly across adolescence. Specifically, for younger adolescents, more prosocial tendencies were associated significantly with less social risk tolerance, whereas for relatively older adolescents, more prosocial tendencies were associated marginally with more social risk tolerance. Additional individual differences by empathy (but not sensation seeking) emerged. These findings suggest that prosocial tendencies across adolescence may be associated with an underlying ability to tolerate social risks.","Armstrong-Carter","Adolescents' perceptions of social risk and prosocial tendencies: Developmental change and individual differences",2023,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"other: social risk and prosocial tendencies",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding public perception and behavior toward influenza pandemics is important for minimizing the effects of such events. Public perception and behavior are expected to change over the course of an influenza pandemic, but this idea has received little attention in previous studies. Our study aimed to understand the dynamics of public perception and behavior over the course of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Three consecutive cross-sectional surveys were administered among Beijing residents with random-digit dialing techniques in March 2008 and August and November 2009. Effective samples of 507, 508 and 1006 respondents were interviewed in each of the three surveys, respectively. The mean scores of risk perception were low to moderate across the three surveys. The perceived risk of infection of self was significantly lower than that of the community, revealing an optimistic bias. Longitudinally, the perceived risk of contracting H1N1 increased, whereas the perceived risk of being unable to obtain medicine and medical care once influenza permeated the community first increased and then decreased. Responsive actions toward influenza varied. Most respondents took actions that required little extra effort, such as ventilating rooms; these actions did not change over time. Comparatively, a smaller number of respondents took actions for coping with influenza, such as vaccination; however, these actions were taken by an increasing number of respondents over time.

In conclusion, the evolving patterns of risk perception and responsive behavior over the course of an influenza pandemic are sensitive to how risk and behavior are defined and scoped. © 2015 Xu, Peng.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Xu","People at Risk of Influenza Pandemics: The Evolution of Perception and Behavior",2015,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: h1n1 influenza pandemic",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china",NA,NA,NA,NA,1006,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.48,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To explore psychosocial correlates and predictors of stage transitions in the Precaution adoption process model (PAPM) for fruit intake. Design. A cohort completed three electronic questionnaires, at baseline (time 0), 35 days later (time 1), and another 32 days later (time 2). Setting. Secured Internet Web site. Subjects. A cohort of 735 adults was formed from a random sample of an existing Internet panel. The mean age was 37.5 years, 51% were women, and 90% were of Dutch origin. Most respondents (48%) had a medium level of education. Measures. Precaution adoption process model stage, risk perception, perception of own fruit intake level, attitude, pros, cons, subjective norms, social support, modeling, self-efficacy, and fruit intake (assessed using a food frequency questionnaire). Analysis. Cross-sectional differences in psychosocial variables and fruit intake across PAPM stages at baseline were analyzed using analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparisons tests. Predictors of PAPM stage transitions between time 0 and time 1 and between time 1 and time 2 were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results. Factors related to attitude and social influences may be important if one is to decide to act, whereas strong self-efficacy may also be required for acting on the decision to act. Conclusion. Although the results should be replicated in a larger and more representative sample, the PAPM seems a good framework, for studying fruit intake.","de Vet","Predictors of Stage Transitions in the Precaution

This may be due to the widespread use of cross-sectional survey designs, which infer causality from theoretical considerations alone. The present longitudinal study, in contrast, builds on the logic that cause precedes effect to confirm the direction of effects. Drawing on two-wave survey data from 554 flood-prone households in Austria, cross-lagged autoregressive models analyze pairwise combinations between risk perception, fear, five nonprotective responses (fatalism, denial, wishful thinking, reliance on social support, reliance on public protection), and seven specific protective responses (ranging from coordination with neighbors to structural modifications of the building). These factors show substantial temporal stability, in particular for nonprotective responses and fear. Only in very few instances can effects over time be confirmed statistically. Nonprotective responses emerge as the major drivers; foremost, denial, and reliance on public protection limit private flood mitigation. This overall null finding on causality may trace back to the 1.5 years' time span and the absence of any policy intervention or flood disaster between survey waves, and the high stability of protection motivation theory components. This finding puts into question the theoretically assumed causal relationships and the effects found in cross-sectional studies. The high trait-like stability requires perseverance in risk management efforts to change attitudes and capabilities. Finding nonprotective responses as key determinants in an overall picture of stability suggests that this factor merits a stronger role in future risk research.","Seebauer","(Almost) all Quiet Over One and a Half Years: A

This research examines US smokers' relative risk perceptions and their prospective association with various behavioral stages of switching to ENDS. Methods Data from the nationally representative, longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Adult survey, Waves 1 (2014) through 5 (2019), were analyzed. We assessed the association between the perceived risk of ENDS relative to cigarettes (less harmful vs. equally harmful or more harmful) and 1) adoption of ENDS (among never-ENDS-using smokers), 2) complete switching to ENDS (i.e., stopping smoking, among ever-ENDS-using smokers), and 3) avoiding reversion to smoking (among smokers who had switched to ENDS), at the next wave. Results The proportion of US smokers perceiving ENDS as less harmful than cigarettes continually decreased, reaching 17.4% in Wave 5 (2019). Current smokers with such belief were more likely to adopt ENDS (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.15-1.50) and switch completely to ENDS (aOR 2.24; 95% CI 1.89-2.65) in the subsequent wave. Among smokers who had switched within the past year, such beliefs predicted avoidance of resumption of smoking in the next wave (aOR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.93). Conclusions Smokers' beliefs about the relative risk of ENDS compared to cigarettes had a strong and consistent association with transitions between smoking and ENDS use. Addressing the growing misperception about ENDS has the potential to contribute to public health by encouraging smokers' switching to ENDS.","Kim","US adult smokers’ perceived relative risk on ENDS and its effects on their transitions between cigarettes and ENDS",2022,"population assessment of tobacco and health (path) data (cohort study, unsure if this identifies as panel???)","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; other: electronic nicotine delivery systems",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,390,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"smokers",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,15431,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Before and after the public meetings, mailed questionnaires measured risk perceptions and perceived credibility of risk managers (here, the state government agencies and the responsible industry) conducting the meetings. Respondents at each measurement point included meeting attendees and nonattendees, with some fluctuation over time when attendees at one measurement point were nonattendees at the next and vice versa. The results from the first survey indicate that following the first two public meetings, attendees perceived greater risks from the waste sites than did nonattendees; attendees also perceived the risk managers as less credible. After the third public meeting, the results showed that attendees' risk perceptions remained steady; however, perceptions of government agency credibility significantly decreased. After the fourth public meeting, the survey found that attendees' risk perceptions were again not significantly different, whereas perceptions of government agency credibility increased significantly. The industry's credibility also increased, though only among attendees who had attended the most recent public meeting, not among attendees who had attended both the third and fourth public meetings.

Using a sample of 1,833 nonabstaining students who completed surveys for seven semesters across the college years, we tested whether personal (i.e., age of drinking onset, gender, risk perceptions, and sensation seeking) and contextual (i.e., college residence) factors were associated with changes in driving after drinking. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found significant individual differences in rates of change in driving after drinking. Male students and students who began drinking earlier in life increased in driving after drinking more rapidly, whereas living in on-campus housing was associated with time-specific decreases in driving after drinking.

Prior reports have suggested that Black Americans experienced lower rates of anxiety and depression than White Americans before the pandemic; however, during the pandemic, outcomes may be different as Black Americans have been disproportionately affected in terms of mortality, hospitalization, COVID-19 infection, and job loss. We documented the differential mental health impact of COVID-19 on Black and Non-Black Americans. Methods We analyzed nationally representative longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study COVID-19 Tracking Survey spanning March through November of 2020 to assess differences over time in prevalence of anxiety and depression between Black and non-Black Americans. Results We found that Black Americans were significantly less likely to report symptoms for anxiety, depression, or both during the pandemic. In a given month between March through November of 2020, the odds of Black Americans reporting such symptoms was on average about half that of Non-Black Americans. We also found that in September 2020, the gap in reporting symptoms for depression began to widen gradually. Specifically, since that time, prevalence of depression remained stable among non-Black Americans while it declined gradually among Black Americans. Our main results were robust to adjusting for demographics, risk perceptions, and baseline pre-pandemic mental health status. Conclusions Black Americans maintained significantly better mental health than Non-Black Americans despite their struggle against economic, health, and racial inequalities during the pandemic.

However, it is important that the information does not increase the expectant parents' psychological distress. The aim was to examine psychological distress among expectant parents, before and after receiving information about PND, to evaluate the possible differences between two different procedures of information giving, and to evaluate the association between satisfaction with the information and psychological distress. Material and methodsA longitudinal design, based on questionnaire data from 380 expectant parents from four counties in Sweden. The measurement points; T1, before the information about PND was given and T2, 2 weeks after the prenatal screening or 15 weeks of gestation. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Swedish version of the Cambridge Worrying Scale (CWS) measured psychological distress. The Satisfaction with Genetic Counseling Scale (SCS) measured satisfaction with information about PND. ResultsThe rate of psychological distress was stable among the pregnant women, but decreased among their partners, after the information was received. General anxiety and the social-medical dimension of pregnancy-related worry decreased among the participants who received information, using the more distinct two-stage process (group A), but was unchanged in group B (less distinct two-stage process). Health-related worry decreased in both groups, whereas relational worry and level of depressive symptoms were unchanged in both groups. ConclusionInformation about PND does not increase the psychological distress among expectant parents. A more distinct two-stage process of information giving might even decrease their anxiety.","Lindgren","Information about first-trimester screening and self-reported distress among pregnant women and partners – comparing two methods of informationgiving in Sweden",2017,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"14",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: pregnancy-related worry",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,105,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"only female",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"sweden",NA,NA,NA,NA,380,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.51,NA,NA,NA,NA,"34.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The success of efforts to achieve an AIDS-free generation - including reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target - thus depends critically on the content of these perceptions. We examined the accuracy of HIV-risk perceptions and their correlates among young black women in South Africa, a group with one of the highest HIV incidence rates worldwide. Methods: We used individual-level longitudinal data from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS) from 2005 to 2009 on black African women (20-30 years old in 2009) to assess the association between perceived HIV-risk in 2005 and the probability of testing HIV-positive four years later. We then estimated multivariable logistic regressions using cross-sectional data from the 2009 CAPS wave to assess the relationship between risk perceptions and a wide range of demographic, sexual behaviour and psychosocial covariates of perceived HIV-risk. Results: We found that the proportion testing HIV-positive in 2009 was almost identical across perceived risk categories in 2005 (no, small, moderate, great) (X-2 = 1.43, p = 0.85). Consistent with epidemiologic risk factors, the likelihood of reporting moderate or great HIV-risk perceptions was associated with condom-use (aOR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.89; p < 0.01); having = 3 lifetime partners (aOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.73; p < 0.01); knowledge of one's partner's HIV status (aOR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.07; p = 0.09); and being in an age-disparate partnerships (aOR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.76; p = 0.02). However, the likelihood of reporting moderate or great self-perceived risk did not vary with sexually transmitted disease history and respondent age, both strong predictors of HIV risk in the study setting. Risk perceptions were associated with stigmatising attitudes (aOR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.09; p = 0.09); prior HIV testing (aOR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.35; p < 0.01); and having heard that male circumcision is protective (aOR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.64; p < 0.01). Conclusions: Results indicate that HIV-risk perceptions are inaccurate. Our findings suggest that this inaccuracy stems from HIV-risk perceptions being driven by an incomplete understanding of epidemiological risk and being influenced by a range of psycho-social factors not directly related to sexual behaviour. Consequently, new interventions are needed to align perceived and actual HIV risk.","Maughan-Brown","Accuracy and determinants of perceived HIV risk among young women in South Africa",2017,"cape area panel study (caps","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: hiv",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Design: Secondary data analysis of longitudinal clinical trial data. Setting: Outpatient clinic in a children's research hospital. Sample: 149 female survivors (aged 12-18 years) a median of 11 years after diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (59%) or solid tumor (41%). Methods: Paired t tests, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance. Main Research Variables: BSE frequency, health risk perceptions, motivation, and fears or worries. Findings: Baseline BSE frequency was the strongest influence on follow-up BSE. Baseline and follow-up age and school grade influenced follow-up BSE. Other influential variables included motivation for behavior change, motivation to commit to health promotion, concern about appearance, and an interaction between the intervention and mother's highest grade level. When baseline BSE frequency and school grade were statistically controlled, diagnosis and significant interactions between grade level and the follow-up measures of the mother's education, general fears about cancer, fears about cancer returning, and perceptions of susceptibility to late treatment effects were significant influences on BSE after intervention. Conclusions: Survivors least likely to perform BSE are fearful about cancer and are not motivated to change health behaviors. Implications for Nursing: Nurses should explore survivors' fears about cancer and late treatment effects to address misconceptions, use modeling techniques with return demonstrations to ensure competency in BSE, and tailor risk information to each survivor's background (socioeconomic status, age, development) and cognitive (disease and treatment knowledge, risks) and affective (fears) characteristics to increase BSE motivation.","Cox","Supporting Breast Self-Examination in Female Childhood Cancer Survivors: A Secondary Analysis of a Behavioral Intervention",2008,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"students",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adolescents",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,149,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15.00

Each assessment point involved home interviews with the children and mothers (stage 1), followed by medical examinations of the children at a clinic (stage 2). Background characteristics, health status, and Chornobyl risk perceptions were examined. Results: The participation rates in the follow-up home interviews were 87.8% for the children (88.6% for evacuees; 87.0% for classmates) and 83.7% for their mothers (86.4% for evacuees and 81.0% for classmates). Children's and mothers' participation was predicted by one another's study participation and attendance at the medical examination at time 1. Mother's participation was also predicted by initial concerns about her child's health, greater psychological distress, and Chornobyl risk perceptions. In 1997, 91.2% of the children had a medical examination (91.7% of evacuees and 90.7% of classmates); in 2005-6, 85.2% were examined (83.0% of evacuees, 87.7% of classmates, 85.0% of population controls). At both times, poor health perceptions were associated with receiving a medical examination. In 2005-6, clinic attendance was also associated with the young adults' risk perceptions, depression or generalized anxiety disorder, lower standard of living, and female gender. Conclusion: Despite our low attrition rates, we identified several determinants of selective participation consistent with previous research. Although evacuee status was not associated with participation, Chornobyl risk perceptions were strong predictors of mothers' follow-up participation and attendance at the medical examinations. Understanding selective participation offers valuable insight for future longitudinal disaster studies that integrate psychiatric and medical epidemiologic research.","Guey","Determinants of participation in a longitudinal two-stage study of the health consequences of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident",2008,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"nuclear power accidents",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Student ratings indicated that they were capable of rationally evaluating alcohol-related risks. Principal components factor analysis identified three factors underlying student responses: propensity/desirability of the behavior, choice/control of the risk, and fear/consequences/likelihood of the risk. Each of these factors was comparable to factors found to be important in past studies of adult risk perception. The finding that self-reported behavioral propensity and desirability were weakly correlated with the measures of perceived risk is of particular interest. Attempts to reduce the use of alcohol by adolescents have traditionally focused on risk awareness.

We also use individual-level fixed-effects regressions to examine how the transition to marriage affects respondents' expectations of future HIV infection. Respondents are consistently more likely to perceive any chance of future HIV infection in the years following marriage than in the years preceding it. Our findings suggest that young women revise their risk perceptions based on their marital experiences and that divorce may serve as a protective strategy for young married women concerned about their chance of future HIV infection.","Grant","HIV Risk Perceptions, the Transition to Marriage, and Divorce in Southern Malawi",2014,"2007–2011 survey rounds of the malawi schooling and

This study assessed the effects of a website with tailored information and a blank sheet to fill in questions (question prompt; QP), at 1 week and 1 year post-counseling. Methods: Consecutive counselees were randomized to the usual care group (UC) or the intervention group (UC + website + QP). Counselees completed questionnaires pre- and post-counseling and 1 year follow-up. We conducted multilevel regression analyses corrected for time. Results: Intervention group counselees (n = 103) were more satisfied about their final visit (beta = .35; CI: .06-.65; P = .02; n = 156) than UC group counselees (n = 94). Intervention group counselees also reported more positive experiences with the counseling (beta = .32; CI: .06-.59; P = .02; n = 188) and higher perceived personal control 1 year post-counseling beta = .51; CI: .18-.84; P = .002; n = 193). No significant effects were found on recall, knowledge, anxiety, cancer worry, risk perception alignment and adherence to breast surveillance advice. Conclusion: This study shows that pre-counseling education providing tailored information and QP, might lead to improvements in experiences with the counseling and perceived personal control 1 year post-counseling. Practice implications: Online pre-visit information is a feasible tool to enhance counselees' experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The study purpose was to examine if disease and treatment cognitive perceptions influence short-term CPAP use. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study included 66, middle-aged (56.7 +/- 10.7 yr) subjects (34 [51.5%] Caucasians; 30 [45.4%] African Americans) with severe OSA (AHI 43.5 events/hr +/- 24.6). Following full-night diagnostic/CPAP polysomnograms, home CPAP use was objectively measured at 1 week and 1 month. The Self Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea (SEMSA) questionnaire, measuring risk perception, outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy, was collected at baseline, post-CPAP education, and after 1 week CPAP treatment. Regression models were used. Results: CPAP use at one week was 3.99 +/- 2.48 h/night and 3.06 +/- 2.43 h/night at one month. No baseline SEMSA domains influenced CPAP use. Post-education self-efficacy influenced one week CPAP use (1.52 +/- 0.53, p = 0.007). Self-efficacy measured post-education and after one week CPAP use also influenced one month CPAP (1.40 +/- 0.52, p = 0.009; 1.20 +/- 0.50, p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusion: Cognitive perceptions influence CPAP use, but only within the context of knowledge of CPAP treatment and treatment use.

A sample of Swiss adults (N = 2,319) indicated their perceptions of a broad set of food and nutrition-related risks (e.g., contamination, pathogens, high salt consumption). These data were collected in two survey waves (in 2018 and 2020, respectively). Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were used to examine which factors influenced perceived risks and which factors influenced changes in perceived risks over a two-year period. The participants' risk perceptions showed some stability over time. Food disgust sensitivity and dietrelated health consciousness had a significant positive influence on perceived risks, and the longitudinal analysis suggests that changes in these two constructs explain changes in perceived risks over a two-year period. Nutrition knowledge was associated with a higher perception of lifestyle risks but a lower perception of other food-related risks. The findings suggest that nutrition knowledge results in greater concern about the food risks that people should be most worried about. Furthermore, food disgust and diet-related health consciousness may not only result in healthier behavior but may also increase perceived risks associated with food hazards (e.g., gluten) that do not need to be of concern to most people. For the Big Five personality traits, only two significant correlations were observed (openness and conscientiousness), and the effect sizes were small. This study suggests that increasing people's diet-related health consciousness and nutrition knowledge may enhance people's perceptions of lifestyle risks.","Siegrist","The impacts of diet-related health consciousness, food disgust, nutrition knowledge, and the Big Five personality traits on perceived risks in the food domain",2022,"swiss food panel 2.0","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: food saftey",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,730,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,2319,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.54,NA,NA,NA,NA,"58",NA,NA,NA,NA,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,"95",NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Three waves of a longitudinal online survey in the UK with smokers pre-standardized packaging (Wave 1: April-May 2016) and followed up post-standardized packaging (Wave 2: September-November 2017, Wave 3: May-July 2019). Of the 6233 smokers at Wave 1, 4293 responded at Wave 2 and 3175 at Wave 3. We explored knowledge of the number of carcinogens in smoke, and whether knowing that smoke contains more than 70 carcinogens mediated change in the belief that the dangers of smoking are exaggerated (risk perception), stubbing out cigarettes, quit intentions and quitting. As the information message is larger on roll-your-own packs than on cigarette packs, as the packs are larger, we also explored whether there was any difference in knowing that smoke contains more than 70 carcinogens between exclusive cigarette smokers and exclusive roll-your-own smokers. Results: Knowledge that there are over 70 carcinogens in smoke increased among smokers across waves, with the increase from Waves 1 to 3 greater for exclusive roll-your-own smokers than exclusive cigarette smokers (adjusted odds ratio=1.44; 95% CI 1.03-2.03). Knowledge that there are over 70 carcinogens in smoke mediated higher risk perception but not stubbing cigarettes out, quit intentions or quitting. Conclusions: The information message improved knowledge of how many carcinogens are in smoke, particularly among exclusive roll-your-own smokers, and this was linked to higher risk perception.","Moodie","The impacts of including information about the number of carcinogens in smoke on standardized cigarette packs in the UK",2021,"online panel of yougov,","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Design: Subjects completed the questionnaire prior to the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Test-retest reliability of the instrument was evaluated by having a subset of subjects complete the SEMSA a second time at home, 1 week later, returning the questionnaire by mail. Patients: 213 subjects with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea were recruited from the clinic populations of 2 sleep disorders centers. Measurements and Results: Content validity was confirmed by a panel of expert judges. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the 3 a priori subscales: risk perception, outcome expectancies, and treatment self-efficacy. The internal consistency of the total instrument was 0.92. Test-retest reliability coefficients (N=20) were estimated to be 0.68, P=0.001, for Perceived Risk, 0.77, P<<0.0001, for Outcome Expectancies; and 0.71, P=0.0005, for the Treatment Self-Efficacy subscale. Subject responses indicated that approximately half of the subjects did not perceive problems with concentration, sexual performance, sleepy driving, or an accident as related to sleep apnea. More than 60% of the subjects acknowledged most of the benefits of CPAP presented to them, but only 53% associated CPAP use with enhanced sexual performance. Frequently identified barriers to treatment use were nasal stuffiness, claustrophobia, and disturbing bed partner sleep. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the SEMSA has strong psychometric properties and has the potential for identifying patient perceptions that may indicate those most likely to not adhere to treatment.","Weaver","Self-Efficacy in Sleep Apnea: Instrument Development and Patient Perceptions of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Risk, Treatment Benefit, and Volition to Use Continuous

A sample of 52 female Swedish nurses attending a postgraduate course in research methodology was chosen. They completed a questionnaire on two occasions spaced 3 weeks apart in the winter of 2000. When the results were analysed, items on sun-related behaviours and sunbed use were sufficiently reliable. The items on skin type and sunburn showed moderate stability. Stage of change related to sunlight exposure, items measuring beliefs about sunbathing along with items assessing self-efficacy and risk perception with regards to sunbathing showed lower stability. The results showed that many essential items concerning exposure to ultraviolet radiation and sunburns were sufficiently stable, but other items were less stable and could be improved upon; suggestions for improving these items are presented.

Preliminary studies have suggested that women with DCIS may overestimate their risk of disease recurrence. Few data exist regarding psychosocial outcomes for women with DCIS. Methods Women in Eastern Massachusetts with newly diagnosed DCIS were asked to participate in a longitudinal study of risk perceptions, psychosocial concerns, and health behaviors. Psychosocial outcomes after DCIS diagnosis and risk perceptions were evaluated at enrollment and at 9 and 18 months. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Four hundred eighty-seven women with DCIS (64% of eligible participants) completed the enrollment survey. Overall quality of life was good among the women surveyed, and the substantial anxiety at enrollment decreased with time (P < .001). At enrollment, 54% perceived at least a moderate risk for DCIS recurrence in the next 5 years, 68% in their lifetime; 39% perceived at least a moderate risk for invasive cancer in the next 5 years, 53% in their lifetime; and 28% perceived at least a moderate likelihood of DCIS spreading to other places in their body. At 18 months after enrollment, perceived risks had not statistically significantly changed from those at enrollment (P = .38). Anxiety at enrollment was the factor that was most consistently and strongly associated with overestimation of future breast cancer-related risks (perceived moderate or greater risk vs less than moderate risk of DCIS recurring within 5 years: odds ratio [OR] = 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6 to 9.9, P = .003; of invasive breast cancer within 5 years: OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.9 to 9.9, P < .001; and of invasive breast cancer during lifetime: OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 2.0 to 14.3, P < .001). Conclusions Many women with newly diagnosed DCIS have inaccurate perceptions of the breast cancer risks that they face, and anxiety is particularly associated with these inaccurate perceptions.","Partridge","Risk Perceptions and Psychosocial Outcomes of Women With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Longitudinal Results From a Cohort Study",2008,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"20",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"not significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,270,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,487,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"53",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26,NA,NA,NA,NA,"89",NA,NA,NA,NA

Design/methodology/approach - Using a longitudinal study, a total of 253 usable responses are collected from time T to time T+1. The paper uses the partial least squares (PLS-Graph 3.0) approach for structural parameters in the proposed model. Findings - The findings show that the temporal effect of performance risk and product usage satisfaction negatively increases, whereas the temporal effect between product usage satisfaction and loyalty intentions decreases over time. While the moderating effect between overall satisfaction of provider and product usage satisfaction strengthens loyalty intentions, the switching costs attenuate loyalty intentions. The proposed model can be used to predict both the change in customer behavior and the moderating effects of overall satisfaction of providers (or switching costs) in the context of smartphone replacement period. Originality/value - This paper makes unique contributions to the literature. First, using the consumption-system approach as a theoretical base, the paper extends the product usage satisfaction-loyalty intentions linkage that can appear as a dynamic spiral during subsequent periods. Second, considering the temporal effects of the proposed relationships, the paper identifies the role of perceived risk that reveals how product usage satisfaction mediates the link between two types of perceived risk and loyalty intentions. Third, the paper emphasizes the importance of moderating effects when considering smartphone usage with a particular brand.","Ha","Investigating temporal effects of risk perceptions and satisfaction on customer loyalty",2014,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"financial; other: satisfaction on customer loyalty",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.85","0.88",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,690,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"south korea",NA,NA,NA,NA,253,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This longitudinal survey studied 1539 high school students in suburban Philadelphia, PA in 11th and 12th grade, before and after the outbreak of EVALI cases in 2019. Adolescents who reported current nicotine vaping at baseline (versus those who did not) had a greater increase in risk perceptions (B = -0.31, p = 0.04) and a greater decrease in positive expectations (B = -1.30, p = 0.003) at follow-up. Adolescents who reported current marijuana vaping at baseline (versus those who did not) had greater perceived benefits (B = 2.19, p < 0.001), lower risk perceptions (B = 0.39, p < 0.001), and greater positive expectations of e-cigarette use (B = 1.43, p < 0.001) across time. Odds of current nicotine vaping at follow-up increased (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.41) for adolescents who maintained lower risk perceptions. Odds of current nicotine vaping at follow-up decreased (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.50) for adolescents whose positive expectations of e-cigarette use decreased. The odds of current marijuana vaping at follow-up decreased (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.42, 0.98) for adolescents whose positive expectations of e-cigarette use decreased. Perceptions of the risks of e-cigarette use increased and positive expectations of e-cigarette use decreased after the EVALI outbreak. Adolescent risk perceptions and positive expectations of e-cigarette use are two potential targets to impact vaping behavior. Emphasizing the risks of e-cigarette use while decreasing positive expectations of use have the potential to reduce vaping behavior, and perhaps subsequent EVALI cases.","Moustafa","Adolescent perceptions of E-cigarette use and vaping behavior before and after the EVALI outbreak",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; health; health catastrophe; other: evali outbreak",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our goal was to evaluate CBC risk perception changes over time among breast cancer patients. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of women with newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer. Patients completed a survey before and approximately 2 years after treatment. Survey questions used open-ended responses or 5-point Likert scale scoring (e.g., 5 = very likely, 1 = not at all likely). A total of 74 women completed the presurgical treatment survey, and 43 completed the postsurgical treatment survey. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between responders and nonresponders of the follow-up survey. The mean estimated 10-year risk of CBC was 35.7 % on the presurgical treatment survey and 13.8 % on the postsurgical treatment survey (p < 0.001). The perceived risks of developing cancer in the same breast and elsewhere in the body significantly decreased between surveys. Both CPM and non-CPM (breast-conserving surgery or unilateral mastectomy) patients' perceived risk of CBC significantly decreased from pre- to postsurgical treatment surveys. Compared with non-CPM patients, CPM patients had a significantly lower perceived 10-year risk of CBC (5.8 vs. 17.3 %, p = 0.046) on postsurgical treatment surveys. The perceived risk of CBC significantly attenuated over time for both CPM and non-CPM patients. These data emphasize the importance of early physician counseling and improvement in patient education to provide women with accurate risk information before they make surgical treatment decisions.","Portschy","Perceptions of Contralateral Breast Cancer Risk: A Prospective, Longitudinal Study",2015,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"cancer ; other: breast cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,949,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"clinical/patients",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,43,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"54",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29,NA,NA,NA,NA,"77",NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Participants were interviewed online twice during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The questionnaire included: (i) The measures of health-related quality of life to perform the Summary Index of Unhealthy Days, (ii) modified items from the Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak and (iii) the items of the General Health Questionnaire. Results: One hundred and thirty professionals out of 130 participated in the first interview, while only 50 therapists took part in the second interview (dropout rate: 61%). The Summary Index of Unhealthy Days was 8 days at the first interview, and it decreased to 6 days at the second interview; however, the reduction was not significant (F = 3.22; p = 0.079). The multivariable analysis showed that the rehabilitation providers with moderate or severe stress level were more likely to have a negative perception of the quality of life (ORadj = 7.155; 95% CI: 2.8-18.2), and this result was confirmed at the second interview. Conclusions: Our results showed that in a severe public health emergency, the mental health and quality of life of rehabilitation professionals must be a topic of focus to enhance psychological resilience, to prevent burnout and to reduce rehabilitation errors.","Confini","Quality of Life among Pediatric Neurocognitive, Speech, and Psychomotor Rehabilitation Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study on an Italian Sample",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Domestic hygiene has rarely been identified as a risk factor for the incidence of campylobacteriosis but due to the high levels of sporadic cases of Campylobacter, cross contamination from kitchen practices remains of significant interest. Due to the complexities of human nature, finding the true risk perceptions and practices that take place in the kitchen is challenging, with social desirability bias affecting the results of surveys and optimistic bias influencing risk perceptions. This study looks at self-reported kitchen behaviours and perceptions of people who have had campylobacteriosis in comparison to people who have not had food poisoning. It also investigates microbiological kitchen hygiene within a smaller sample. The survey crucially includes a longitudinal element to investigate any change that may take place after a period of six months has elapsed. Optimistic bias was evident in both groups and no significant difference in perception was noted in the baseline study. However, the longitudinal study showed that individuals who had not had food poisoning increased their optimism, introducing a significant difference in optimistic bias between the two groups after six months had elapsed. Self-reported kitchen behaviours also exhibited a difference between the two groups, with the individuals who had campylobacteriosis responding more favourably with the exception of washing chicken and washing salad leaves sold in a bag. No evidence of kitchen hygiene differences could be found between the people who had suffered campylobacteriosis in comparison to people who had not.had food poisoning. The results of the survey demonstrate that more effective food safety communication is required. Important messages such as 'not washing chicken' seem not to have been absorbed and the good practices become routine. These messages need particularly to be aimed towards people who may not perceive themselves as being at risk of getting food poisoning, such as the young, although the challenge of changing the practice of those who perceive themselves to be at low risk remains.

The aim of this study was to assess parental anxiety levels after 5 years of participation in the Diabetes Prediction in Skane study. Associations between parental anxiety about their child developing type 1 diabetes and clinical, demographic, and immunological factors were analyzed. Method Mothers and fathers of participating 5-year-old children answered a questionnaire regarding parental anxiety associated with their child's increased risk of type 1 diabetes. Anxiety levels were assessed using the State Anxiety Inventory scale. Data were analyzed using logistic and multinomial regression. Results Parents of 2088 5-year-old children participated. Both parents answered the questionnaire for 91.2% (n = 1904) of children. In 67.1% of families, neither parent reported being anxious that their child had an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Anxiety was higher in mothers of children positive for autoantibodies (OR 2.21 95% CI 1.41, 3.48, P < .001) and those perceiving their child had a higher risk for type 1 diabetes (2.01; 1.29, 3.13, P = .002). Frequency of worry was associated with parental anxiety (mothers 5.33; 3.48, 8.17, P < .001, fathers 5.27; 3.51, 7.92, P < .001). Having a family member with type 1 diabetes and having lower education level were also associated with increased anxiety. Conclusions Diabetes in the family, the child's autoantibody status, education level, frequency of worry and risk perception where associated with higher parental anxiety. These findings add to our understanding of the impact of screening for type 1 diabetes in children on parental anxiety.","Melin","Parental anxiety after 5 years of participation in a longitudinal study of children at high risk of type 1 diabetes",2020,"data available upon request","longitudinal","worry","risk",NA,NA,NA,"single item","single item",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"1",1,NA,NA,NA,"5",5,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: diabetes",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: One hundred nineteen correctional officers (109 males and 10 females) employed in Turkey participated in this study. In addition to WSSCO, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were administered to the participants. Results: The internal consistencies and the item-total correlations were acceptable both for the whole scale and for its subscales; namely, work overload, role conflict and role ambiguity, inadequacies in physical conditions of prison, threat perception, and general problems. Test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.77 for total scale, and test-retest reliability coefficients ranged between 0.68 and 0.78 for the subscales. The total scale and most of the subscales were positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, and negatively correlated with perceived social support. Furthermore, all subscales significantly differentiated high depressive symptomatology group from the low depressive symptomatology group.

Autoregressive analyses indicate that, at the personal level, personal hygiene behavior was predicted by personal infection risk perception. At social level, social distancing behaviors such as abstaining from face-to-face contact were predicted by perceived social norms. Support for behavioral mandates was predicted by confidence in the government and cultural tightness, whereas support for anti-lockdown protests was predicted by (lower) perceived clarity of communication about the virus.

Correlation and logistic regression analyses were employed to examine longitudinal relationships between stressors and distress in a randomly drawn sample of 741 employees from the Norwegian petroleum offshore industry. Time lag between baseline and follow-up was 6 months. Work environment stressors included safety factors, leadership, and job characteristics. The prevalence of psychological distress was 9 % at baseline and 8 % at follow-up. All investigated work environment factors correlated with subsequent distress. In bivariate logistic regression analyses, caseness of distress was predicted by baseline distress, near miss accidents, risk perception, poor safety climate, tyrannical leadership, laissez-faire leadership, job demands, and workplace bullying. After adjustment for baseline distress, control variables, and other predictors, laissez-faire leadership (OR = 1.69; 95 % CI: 1.12-2.54) and exposure to bullying (OR = 1.49; 95 % CI: 1.07-2.10) emerged as the most robust predictors of subsequent distress. The findings show that the prevalence of psychological distress is lower among offshore employees than in the general population. Although offshore workers operate in a physically challenging context, their mental health is mainly influenced by stressors in the psychosocial work environment. This highlights the importance of developing and implementing psychosocial safety interventions within the offshore industry.","Nielsen","Prevalence and occupational predictors of psychological distress

Methods The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake.","Phillips","Perceived threat of COVID-19, attitudes towards

An adolescent community sample (N = 243; Wave 1 demographics: 45% female, 51% non-white, 49% white, mean age = 13.06 years) completed self-report questionnaires annually for five years. Measures included the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire - Adolescent Brief Version, one Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) item assessing annual perceived drinking risk, an adapted item from the YRBS assessing annual alcohol use, the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale. We specified dual latent growth curves to estimate trajectories of change in perceived drinking risk and alcohol use over time. Alcohol use significantly increased, while perceived drinking risk significantly decreased. More positive alcohol expectancies at baseline predicted a less steep decline in perceived drinking risk (beta = 0.31, p = .009), whereas more negative expectancies at baseline predicted a steeper decline in perceived risk (beta = -0.26, p = .03). Alcohol expectancies did not directly predict alcohol use, but instead operated indirectly via the starting point of the perceived drinking risk trajectory. Specifically, greater positive expectancies (B = -0.19, p < .001) and lower negative expectancies (B = 0.17, p = 0.006) predicted a lower risk perception trajectory starting point, which then predicted a greater alcohol use trajectory starting point (B = -1.41, p < .001). Findings underscore the starting point of perceived drinking risk trajectories as one factor linking alcohol expectancies and alcohol use. Prevention efforts aimed at shifting these starting points and altering early cognitive factors may be appropriate targets for minimizing alcohol use risk.","Shadur","Alcohol use and perceived drinking risk trajectories across adolescence: the role of alcohol expectancies",2021,"data available upon request","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"drugs; other: alcohol",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"correlation",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.58","0.55","0.45","0.42","0.43","0.38","0.42","0.42","0.54",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adolescents",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,277,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.45,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13.06",NA,NA,NA,NA,0.9,NA,NA,NA,NA,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15",NA,NA,NA,NA

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively.

Methods: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant's county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment.

Results: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased.

Conclusions: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.

Objective: We addressed two related questions: How did emotions change across various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to what extent were preventive behaviors predicted by emotional reactions and information acquisition? Methods: We conducted a four-wave longitudinal study in the United States and China across four stages of the pandemic: prepandemic, onset of viral outbreak, ongoing risk, and contained risk. We measured emotions, life satisfaction, preventive behaviors, acquisition of COVID-19 related information, and risk perceptions. We used the Emotional Recall Task (ERT) to investigate people's emotions. By allowing people to describe their emotional experience in their own words, the ERT evaluates each individual based on emotions relevant to their personal experience, making it more suitable for a wider range of contexts and social groups. Results: Boredom, anxiety, fear, and worry were common emotional reactions to the pandemic as it emerged. Surprisingly, participants' emotional experience did not mirror infection and death rates: Instead of negative emotions growing as the virus spread, emotions soon reverted back to normality. This pattern held regardless of whether the viral spread was contained. Consequently, people's preventive behaviors were predicted by fear, anxiety, and worry only at the onset of the viral outbreak. In contrast, actively acquiring information and knowledge about COVID-19 had a more enduring effect on the engagement of preventive behaviors in both countries. Conclusion: Our research suggests a possible life cycle of emotional reactions towards a pandemic and highlights the importance of people acquiring information and knowledge about the threat in containing its spread.","Li","Changing emotions in the COVID-19 pandemic: A four-wave longitudinal study in the United States and China",2021,"https://osf.io/6x2bv/; amazon mechanical turk","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: covid-19",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china, usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,962,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.475,NA,NA,NA,NA,"37.6",NA,NA,NA,NA,11.35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies investigating the travelers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) profile indicated an important educational need among those traveling to risk destinations. Initiatives to improve such education should target all groups of travelers, including business travelers, those visiting friends and relatives (VFR), and older adult travelers. Methods. In the years 2002 to 2009, a longitudinal questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Dutch Schiphol Airport with the aim to study trends in KAP of travel risk groups toward prevention of hepatitis A. The risk groups last-minute travelers, solo travelers, business travelers, travelers VFR, and older adult travelers were specifically studied. Results. A total of 3,045 respondents were included in the survey. Travelers to destinations with a high risk for hepatitis A had significantly less accurate risk perceptions (knowledge) than travelers to low-to-intermediate-risk destinations. The relative risk for hepatitis A in travelers to high-risk destinations was probably mitigated by less intended risk-seeking behavior and by higher protection rates against hepatitis A as compared with travelers to low-to-intermediate-risk destinations. Logistic regression analyses showed that an age > 60 years was the only significant determinant for improvement of their knowledge. Trend analyses showed a significant change over time in attitude toward more risk-avoiding behavior and toward higher protection rates against hepatitis A in travelers to high-risk destinations. The KAP profile of the risk groups travelers VFR (irrespective of hepatitis A risk of their destination) and solo as well as last-minute travelers to high-risk destinations substantially increased their relative risk for hepatitis A. Conclusions. The results of this longitudinal survey in Dutch travelers suggest an annual 5% increase in protection rates against hepatitis A coinciding with an annual 1% decrease in intended risk-seeking behavior.

After the process of translation and back-translation, the Turkish version was pilot-tested, and its test-retest reliability was evaluated among 40 parents at a two-week interval. The validation was carried out with 306 parents through exploratory factor analysis. There was no statistical difference between the test-retest scores (p = .17). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.98 (p < .001). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.81.

Yet, few longitudinal studies have assessed how perceived risk relates to risk indicators among different disease risk groups. We examined in a 5-year follow-up, whether perceived risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease predicted physical activity, body mass index (BMI kg/m(2)), and blood glucose level, or the reverse. We examined further whether perceived risk, self-efficacy, and outcome beliefs together predicted changes in these risk indicators. Method Participants were high diabetes risk participants (N = 432) and low/moderate-risk participants (N = 477) from the national FINRISK 2002 study who were followed up in 2007. Both study phases included questionnaires and health examinations with individual feedback letters. Data were analyzed using gender- and age-adjusted structural equation models. Results In cross-lagged autoregressive models, perceived risks were not found to predict 5-year changes in physical activity, BMI, or 2-h glucose. In contrast, higher BMI and 2-h glucose predicted 5-year increases in perceived risks (beta-values 0.07-0.15,P-values < 0.001-0.138). These associations were similar among high- and low/moderate-risk samples. In further structural equation models, higher self-efficacy predicted increased physical activity among both samples (beta-values 0.10-0.16,P-values 0.005-0.034). Higher outcome beliefs predicted lower BMI among the low/moderate-risk sample (beta-values - 0.04 to - 0.05,P-values 0.008-0.011). Conclusion Perceived risk of chronic disease rather follows risk indicators than predicts long-term lifestyle changes. To promote sustained lifestyle changes, future intervention studies need to examine the best ways to combine risk feedback with efficient behavior change techniques.","Vornanen","Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Perception and Risk Indicators: a 5-Year Follow-up",2021,NA,"longitudinal","risk","risk",NA,NA,NA,"single item","single item",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"1",1,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: diabetes",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"correlation","correlation",NA,NA,NA,"0.58",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.55",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1825,1825,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,"clinical/patients","clinical/patients",NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"finland","finland",NA,NA,NA,909,909,NA,NA,NA,0.577,0.577,NA,NA,NA,"55.9",55.9,NA,NA,NA,6.9,6.9,NA,NA,NA,45,45,NA,NA,NA,"74",74,NA,NA,NA

This study was designed to assess changes in perceived risk, cognitive intrusions and distress in women undergoing counselling for familial risk of developing breast cancer. Design. A longitudinal design in which 90 consecutive women attending a family history clinic were asked to indicate their concerns before counselling and then again 3 and 6 months post-counselling. Method. Questionnaires included measures of thought content and intrusiveness, cancer specific distress (Cockburn, De Luise, Hurley, & Clover, 1992), a Visual Analogue scale (VAS) of perceived risk, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Results. Sixty-nine women agreed to rake part in the study, with 49 completing all three sets of questionnaires. Before counselling, thought intrusiveness and HAD depression scores accounted for 69% of the variance in the measure of cancer specific distress. Women who dropped out of the study before the post-counselling assessments reported higher levels of intrusiveness at baseline than those who completed the study Perceived risk was only moderately related to actual risk post-counselling and increases/decreases in thought intrusiveness correlated positively with increases/decreases in both perceived risk and distress. Conclusions. Psychological distress is related co levels of perceived risk, a relationship which may be mediated by thought intrusiveness. It could be more appropriate for generic counselling services co provide strategies for managing intrusiveness of worries rather than attempting to modify risk perceptions.","Kent","The relationship between perceived risk, thought intrusiveness and emotional well-being in women receiving counselling for breast cancer risk in a family history clinic",2000,NA,"longitudinal","risk","risk","risk",NA,NA,"scale","scale","scale",NA,NA,"range","range","range",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",3,3,NA,NA,"single","single","single",NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer ; other: breast cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,NA,NA,"correlation","correlation","correlation",NA,NA,"0.71",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.73","0.79",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,180,90,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"uk","uk",NA,NA,49,49,49,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,"36.8",36.8,36.8,NA,NA,7.3,7.3,7.3,NA,NA,23,23,23,NA,NA,"63",63,63,NA,NA

The objective was to assess the evolution of mental health indicators of Brazilian health workers providing care to COVID-19 patients, considering the beginning and first wave of the pandemic, identifying risk and protective factors. A non-probabilistic sample of health professionals was assessed for 6 months at seven different points in time using standardized instruments to measure anxiety, depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress, and burnout symptoms. Risk and protective factors were assessed using a questionnaire addressing socio-demographic, clinical, occupational variables, and COVID-19 risk perception. The results indicate high rates for all the indicators (>30%) throughout the follow-up; only anxiety symptoms decreased in the different phases compared to the baseline. Depression and insomnia symptoms showed a significant drop in isolated points of the assessment, which were not maintained at the final follow-up. Burnout indicators concerning emotional exhaustion and depersonalization remained stable (40 and 20%), while professional achievement decreased by approximately 19%. Occupational and personal characteristics (profession and work setting), perceptions regarding protective measures imposed by the institutions, and future professional prospects stood out as risk/protective factors in mental health. Unlike European and Asian countries, where mental distress symptoms tended to decrease over the pandemic, this study's results suggest alarming indicators of mental health problems remaining stable with burnout symptoms on the rise. Hence, the different contexts across countries, with different management resources and investments in health actions, seem to influence workers' mental health differently, demanding constant attention and monitoring and measures to minimize the impacts on individuals and collectives, especially in less developed countries like Brazil.","Osório","Monitoring the Mental Health and Professional Overload of Health Workers in Brazil: A Longitudinal Study Considering the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic",2022,"data available upon request","longitudinal","concern",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; other: mental health and professional overload of health workers",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Participants were 464 adults who completed the baseline and at least two follow-up assessments on their H7N9-related Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Severity, Perceived Efficacy, Worry, Social Norms influence and Protective Behaviours in a five-phase longitudinal survey over one H7N9 epidemic wave. Latent growth modelling (LGM) identified trajectories of these psycho-behavioural responses while multi-process LGM examined the inter-relationships among trajectories of Social Norms influence, Worry and Protective Behaviours. Results: Trajectories of Perceived Susceptibility, Worry, Social Norms and Protective Behaviours increased initially but declined as the epidemic decayed, while Perceived Severity increased linearly and Perceived Efficacy remained stable across the epidemic. Change in Social Norms influence was significantly associated with change in Worry (beta = 0.65) which was significantly associated with change in Protective Behaviours (beta = 0.62). Conclusion: The public's threat appraisal but not efficacy appraisal may have been well-informed by epidemic-related information. Social Norms may be important contributors of public emotional response to an epidemic. Communication via social networks during an epidemic could be important for regulating public emotional response and guiding their behavioural change.","Liao","Trajectories of public psycho-behavioural responses relating to influenza A(H7N9) over the winter of 2014-15 in Hong Kong",2019,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: influenza a (h7n9)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people's acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. Method: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). Results: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults' compliance with protective measures over time. Conclusions: This study offers insights into the behavioural responses of older adults to an ongoing threat and the associated uncertainty that is part of public communication about the pandemic and protective measures.","Bearth","Reactions of older Swiss adults to the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal  survey on the acceptance of and adherence to public health measures",2021,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"older adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"switzerland",NA,NA,NA,NA,327,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.31,NA,NA,NA,NA,"70",NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,59,NA,NA,NA,NA,"90",NA,NA,NA,NA

Negative attitudes have been associated with vaccine hesitancy and outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the globe. This study aimed to assess how and why attitudes become more pro-vaccine or vaccine-skeptical over time, and which sources are especially influential in this process. Methods: Prospective cohort study with measurements at time of recruitment during pregnancy and at +3, +6 and +14 months after childbirth with cross-sectional control groups. In total, 351 women entered the longitudinal analyses, while 204, 215 and 173 women were recruited in the cross-sectional control groups, respectively. Inclusion criteria were: (i) being at least 18 years of age, (ii) pregnant, (iii) primigravida, and (iv) living in Germany. Results: During pregnancy mothers reported rather positive prior experiences with vaccinations. However, their judgment turned significantly more negative after the first vaccination experience with their child. Mixed-effects models showed that these changes were significantly related to increased risk perceptions and concerns about vaccination, which then had a negative impact on the vaccination attitude. In contrast, gaining more vaccine-related knowledge over time positively influenced attitude formation. Conclusions: During the first year of their child's life maternal attitudes towards vaccination are formed and guide future decisions whether to vaccinate or not vaccinate a child. Strategies should be implemented that improve mothers' experiences when their newborn is vaccinated to prevent the development of vaccine hesitancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on the uncertain health risks of mobile phone cell sites. We quantitatively survey a national level panel of citizens in the Netherlands and make use of mixed-method panels of citizens who are being confronted with siting practices in the Netherlands and Southern California. We find that often and unsurprisingly cell site deployment is of limited importance in the everyday lives of citizens. However, at closer inspection we find three ways in which risk governance affects citizens' experiences. First, the framing of cell site deployment among citizens closely resembles the frames in policy. Second, following the depoliticization of cell phone health risks, the absence of alarming health effects and the withering of public debate, a stable three quarter of citizens seems unconcerned for a couple of years, while an equally stable quarter reports health worries. This stability is in line with the stabilized dominant policy discourse. Third, on an individual and local level, we do find some changes in citizens' risk perception, framings, feelings and - albeit very limited, actions. These changes can partly be traced to local siting procedures. Our findings point to the need to examine the concrete practices through which a problem and its public emerge over time in the context of wider dominant political discourses.","de Graaff","Governance and risk in everyday life: depoliticization and citizens' experiences of cell site deployment in the Netherlands and Southern California",2019,"dutch national level panel","serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"other: technological (cell site deployment)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We hypothesized that being informed of a positive islet autoantibody (IA) would increase monitoring behaviors. Research Design and Methods The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study follows 8676 children with high-risk human leucocyte antigen-DQ genotypes from birth to age 15, including general population (GP) children and those with a first-degree relative (FDR) with diabetes. Data on parental monitoring behaviors were solicited yearly. Serum samples were tested for IA and parents were informed of child results. We examined parental monitoring behaviors during the first 7 years of TEDDY. Results In IA- children, the most common monitoring behavior was participating in TEDDY study tasks; up to 49.8% and 44.2% of mothers and fathers, respectively, reported this. Among FDRs, 7%-10% reported watching for diabetes symptoms and 7%-9% reported monitoring the child's glucose, for mothers and fathers, respectively. After IA+ notification, all monitoring behaviors significantly increased in GP parents; only glucose monitoring increased in FDR parents and these behaviors continued for up to 4 years. FDR status, accurate diabetes risk perception, and anxiety were associated with glucose monitoring in IA+ and IA- cohorts. Conclusions Many parents view TEDDY participation as a way to monitor for type 1 diabetes, a benefit of enrollment in a longitudinal study with no prevention offered. IA+ notification increases short- and long-term monitoring behaviors.

Each diary collected data on the stressors experienced, stressor intensity and threat/challenge perception (appraisal), coping strategies used, and perceived coping effectiveness.Results: General performance, outcome, critical moment performance, and teammate mistakes accounted for 55% of the stressors reported. More stressors were reported in competitive diaries than in training diaries. Competitive stressors were rated as being more intense than training stressors. There were no differences in overall challenge and threat perception, but performance stressors were more likely to be perceived as a challenge, and teammate stressors were more likely to be perceived as a threat. Problem-focused coping (PFC) was the most frequently employed coping strategy. PFC and emotion-focused coping (EFC) strategies were perceived as more effective at reducing stress than avoidance coping (AC).Conclusions: Elite LoL athletes experienced a small number of reoccurring stressors over an 87-day competitive period. Athletes reported more stressors around competitive matches and perceived competitive stressors as more intense than team and solo training stressors. Similarly to traditional sports athletes, PFC strategies were the most frequently employed and, PFC and EFC were rated as being more effective than AC.","Poulus","Longitudinal analysis of stressors, stress, coping and coping effectiveness in elite esports athletes",2022,NA,"longitudinal","threat",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: stress and coping in esports",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: Study subjects (n = 1,082, age 55-94 years) were female Australian participants of the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW). Self-administered questionnaires were sent annually from 2007 to 2010. Study outcomes included 'concern about osteoporosis', 'perception of getting osteoporosis' and 'perception of fracture risk' compared to similar aged women. The closest post-BMD testing or baseline questionnaires were used for women with and without BMD testing, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression was used for the analysis.

Results: BMD testing, prior fracture after age 45, younger age and lower self-reported general health were significantly associated with being 'very' or 'somewhat concerned' about osteoporosis and having a 'much higher' or 'little higher' risk perception of osteoporosis and fractures. A poorer BMD result was associated with higher concern and higher risk perceptions. The presence of comorbidities, having ≥2 falls in the preceding year and maternal osteoporosis were associated with higher concern. Maternal osteoporosis, presence of comorbidities, weight loss of ≥5 kg in the preceding year and low body mass index were associated with higher perceptions of osteoporosis risk.

Conclusion: Women's concern and risk perception of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures were reasonably well founded. However, increasing age, height loss, smoking and drinking were not associated with concern and perception despite being known osteoporosis risk factors. These factors should be considered in planning for education and awareness raising programmes.","Bacenilla-Wong","Concern and risk perception of osteoporosis and fracture among post-menopausal Australian women: results from the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW) cohort",2013,NA,"longitudinal","risk","concern",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",4,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While determinants of condom use among sub-Saharan African adolescents have been studied extensively, factors related to abstinence have received far less attention. This study identified socio-cognitive determinants of primary and secondary abstinence intentions and of early sexual activity. This study also assessed whether these factors had a direct or indirect association with intentions to abstain from sex. A longitudinal design was used in which 1670 students (age 12-16) of non-private South African high schools filled in a questionnaire, with a follow-up after 6 months, concerning sexual abstinence, attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, risk perception and knowledge. Logistic and linear regression analysis with latent factors was used to assess determinants of intentions and abstinence, and structural equation modelling was used to assess indirect effects. Results showed that among sexually inactive students, social norms predicted the intention to abstain from sex in the next 6 months. Among sexually active students, reporting less disadvantages of abstinence predicted the intention to abstain. Sexual activity at follow-up was predicted by attitudes and intention among sexually inactive girls, and by knowledge among sexually inactive boys. No predictors were found for sexually active adolescents. Structural equation modelling further showed that risk perception was indirectly related to intentions to abstain from sexual intercourse. We conclude that addressing socio-cognitive factors in order to motivate adolescents to delay sex is more likely to be successful before they experience sexual debut. In addition, this study shows that the effect of increasing risk perceptions, a strategy often applied by parents and HIV prevention programmes, is to a large extent mediated by more proximal cognitive factors such as attitude. Research is needed to identify factors that influence the execution of intentions to abstain from sex.","Eggers","Predicting Primary and Secondary Abstinence Among Adolescent Boys and Girls in the Western Cape, South Africa",2017,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"correlation",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.49","0.43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"students",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adolescents",NA,NA,NA,NA,"south africa",NA,NA,NA,NA,1670,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.61,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13.6",NA,NA,NA,NA,1.01,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,"16",NA,NA,NA,NA

Results: As expected, reported influenza experience was associated with increased perceived influenza risk in subsequent survey waves. Furthermore, perceived risk was associated with subsequent vaccination behavior, such that vaccination was more common for those with higher perceived unvaccinated influenza risk and lower perceived vaccinated influenza risk. Perhaps surprisingly, both elements of perceived risk were also associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent reported influenza illness. This malleability in illness reports may reflect uncertainty, as more respondents reported being sick but being unsure about whether they had influenza than reported certainty that they had influenza. Conclusions: Interventions that influence perceptions about past experience with influenza, including increased testing and informational campaigns about influenza symptoms, could have unanticipated impacts on perceptions of influenza vaccination and vaccination behavior.","Nowak","Reciprocal relationships among influenza experiences, perceptions, and behavior: Results from a national, longitudinal survey of United States adults",2022,"rand american life panel (alp)","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: influenza",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor's recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents' intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine's safety.

However, par-ticipants who tested chlamydia positive reported stronger increases in health goals and intentions towards condom use, and stronger decreases in the number of partners and stigma, compared to participants who tested negative. Furthermore, condom use increased in chlamydia positive, and decreased in chlamydia negative participants. A treatment consultation/positive test result had a risk-reducing impact on behavioral and psy-chological characteristics, whereas the impact of a test consultation was limited. Since the majority of young heterosexuals test chlamydia negative, alternative interventions (e.g., online) achieving risk-reducing behavior change targeted to individuals who tested negative are needed.","van Wees","The impact of STI test results and face-to-face consultations on subsequent behavior and psychological characteristics",2020,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: sti",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"netherlands",NA,NA,NA,NA,572,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,"24",NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, it is not surprising that they express concerns about the safety of their food supplies. A technology proposed to improve consumer trust in food safety is irradiation. Despite extensive education efforts and endorsements given by many health-related organizations worldwide, food irradiation has been slow to gain widespread acceptance. This ineffectiveness of diffusion efforts might indicate a need to broaden our theoretical perspectives of consumer acceptance of controversial technologies. Most theoretical approaches explain acceptance primarily as a function of perceived risks associated with a technology. The recreancy theorem, in contrast, explains acceptance as a function of public trust in societal institutions to effectively manage a technology. This study investigated the extent to which the recreancy theorem explained acceptance of food irradiation by US consumers, while statistically controlling for perceived risk and social-demographic variables. The study used a longitudinal field design to survey one adult each in 116 households located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area during the first large-scale market test of irradiated food. The results indicate that the recreancy theorem might provide a valid conceptual approach to gaining a broader understanding of consumer acceptance of controversial new technologies.","Sapp","Consumer acceptance of food irradiation: a test of the recreancy theorem",2009,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: food safety",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,116,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.62,NA,NA,NA,NA,"50.89",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relationship between these behaviors and adolescents' perceptions of peer involvement, personal invulnerability, and risks and benefits was investigated. A two-wave longitudinal study among a representative sample of 1,445 Dutch adolescents aged 12-17 was conducted (49% females). Autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation models revealed that perceived peer involvement, perceived vulnerability, and perceived risks were all significant predictors of risky sexual online behavior 6 months later.

Longitudinal cross-lagged path models were estimated to explore the relationships between perceived risk, worry, and emotional distress. Results gave support to earlier studies by showing that cross-sectional measures of risk and worry were weakly related. Across time, worry and emotional distress were reciprocally related. Perceived risk had impact on worry but not on emotional distress. Neither worry nor emotional distress influenced perceived risk. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis postulates a direct effect of feelings onto behavioural choice, and a reciprocal relation between cognitive evaluations and feelings. Our findings do not support a reciprocal relation between judgements of risk and feelings, but an impact from risk on to worry. Between various measures of feelings reciprocity seems to exist.

Overall, the results identified purchase/transport time and purchase order as the emerging and unchanged risk factors, respectively. Consumers' preferences into channels for purchase (large discount stores rather than small/traditional markets) and transport (using cars or delivery) implied the convenience as the noticeable trend. Whereas, unexpected increases in purchase/transport time highlighted the underestimated risks in long-term exposure of foods under inadequate temperature. Food should not be exposed to danger zones > 1-2 h, but consumers might be unaware of the risk especially for preferred channels (e.g., 77 and 36 min. are required for purchase and transport from large discount stores, respectively). In the case of unchanged risky behavior, more than half of consumers in both surveys did not follow proper purchasing orders.

First, we identified the educational needs of food handlers and managers based on a FS-culture assessment, followed by the implementation of educational actions using three formats (tutored, planned, and with the managers). A previously developed mixed-method approach was used for the collection of qualitative and quantitative data, data triangulation, and an interpretation grid that was used for categorisation into reactive, active, or proactive FS-culture. The triangulated data showed that the prevailing FS-culture changed from reactive to more proactive during the longitudinal study. The educational actions changed attitudes, practices, personal relationships, and the work environment. The educational actions were effective in influencing the prevailing FS-culture and confirmed the research hypothesis. Furthermore, the mixed-method approach with the interpretation grid was useful in assessing the transition in the prevailing FS-culture.

Additionally, the mediating role of perceived personal risk has not been examined. Methods: In this study, representative samples of smokers in Denmark (a smoking lenient country; N = 429) and the United States (a smoking prohibitive country; N = 431) completed surveys 6 months apart. Results: As expected, Danish smokers (compared to U. S. smokers) moralized less and estimated that their personal risk of lung cancer was smaller. Furthermore, moralization at T1 predicted an increase in perceived personal risk at T2 (for Danish smokers and marginally for U. S. smokers), a decrease in smoking behaviors (for Danish smokers only), and an increase in quitting intentions (marginally for Danish smokers only). For Danish smokers, perceived personal risk mediated the relationship between moralization and quitting intentions.

Methods: As part of a longitudinal cohort study, participants of a community health screening (N = 1,055) received their actual cholesterol readings. Feedback reception was assessed immediately, at one month and six months. Results: Processing trajectories for unexpected positive feedback showed a significant 'lack of reassurance' effect over time compared with expected positive feedback, while unexpected negative feedback was less threatening than expected negative feedback.

Results Health anxiety, media consumption, female gender, lower self-assessed health, knowing a deceased COVID-19 patient and being infected explained variance in threat appraisal. Worries represented 2 factors: psychosocial and existential. Threat appraisal and worries explained variance in illness representations. Representations of the disease worsened and started stabilizing over time. Emotional representations were exceptionally stable and explainable by threat appraisals. Conclusions These studies revealed the initial stages of developing representations of a new disease in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaining insights into those representations is key to understanding, predicting and modifying behavioral and mental responses to the pandemic.","Shiloh","Making sense of COVID-19: a longitudinal investigation of the initial stages of developing illness representations",2022,"data available upon request","longitudinal","threat","worry",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: covid-19",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"correlation",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.49","0.66",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,120,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"israel",NA,NA,NA,NA,422,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.49,NA,NA,NA,NA,"41.99",NA,NA,NA,NA,15.08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is limited data available on the longitudinal nature of such associations and what aspects of risk appraisal and characteristics of subjects are relevant. Objective: To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between risk appraisal measures and nonspecific symptoms, and assess the role of subject characteristics (sex, age, education, trait negative affect) in a general population cohort. Methods: This study was nested in the Dutch general population AMIGO cohort that was established in 2011/2012, when participants were 31-65 years old. We studied a sample of participants (n = 1720) who filled in two follow-up questionnaires in 2013 and 2014, including questions about perceived exposure, perceived risk, and health concerns as indicators of risk appraisal of base stations, and non-specific symptoms. Results: Perceived exposure, perceived risk, and health concerns, respectively, were associated with higher symptom scores in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Only health concerns (not perceived exposure and perceived risk) temporally preceded high symptom scores and vice versa. Female sex, younger age, higher education, and higher trait negative affect were associated with higher risk appraisal of mobile phone base stations. Discussion: The findings in this study strengthen the evidence base for cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between higher risk appraisal and non-specific symptoms in the general population. However, the directionality of potential causal relations in non-sensitive general population samples should be examined further in future studies, providing information to the benefit of risk communication strategies.","Martens","Longitudinal associations between risk appraisal of base stations for mobile phones, radio or television and non-specific symptoms",2018,NA,"longitudinal","risk","concern",NA,NA,NA,"scale","single item",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"3",1,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; other: base stations for mobile, phones, radio or television",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"correlation","correlation",NA,NA,NA,"0.55",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.60",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,365,365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"netherlands","netherlands",NA,NA,NA,1720,1720,NA,NA,NA,0.53,0.53,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,31,NA,NA,NA,"60",60,NA,NA,NA

This paper reports on the development and preliminary psychometric evaluation of a new measure of threat appraisal for children and adolescents - the Threat Appraisal Questionnaire for Children (TAQ-C). Based on current conceptualisations of threat appraisal, the TAQ-C was designed to index the construct across three dimensions: probability, cost, and coping difficulties. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to examine this structure in a community sample of n = 312 children (ages 9-15 years, 55% female). Results indicated that the scores on the instrument capture three factors (Probability, Cost and Coping difficulties). Moreover, a model in which the 1st-order factors loaded significantly on a single 2nd order factor of threat in general, was supported. The TAQ-C was found to demonstrate good internal consistency, and acceptable levels of test-retest reliability within a 3-4 week interval, when evaluated with a subsample of n = 51 children. Support for convergent validity was demonstrated, with TAQ-C scores found to correlate strongly with existing measures of child anxiety, and conceptually related cognitive processes. Divergent validity was also evidenced, with low correlations found between TAQ-C scores and the unrelated construct measure of Hyperactivity-Inattention. The TAQ-C, therefore, appears to be a promising measure with a range of potential applications for child and adolescent settings.","Francis","Development and Preliminary Validation of the Threat Appraisal Questionnaire for Children (TAQ-C)",2017,NA,"longitudinal","threat",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: children",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.78",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"children",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,312,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.55,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15",NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on the idea that catastrophic events (CEs) affect people's perceptions of reality and judgments about the future, this paper analyzes the effect of CEs on people's worries in terms of social, economic, and environmental issues. In particular, we consider the terrorist attack 9/11 in 2001, the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, and the nuclear disaster in Fukushima in 2011. We propose two possible mechanisms: A CE in one sphere may affect people's worries in general (spillover) or it may lead to people focusing on that sphere and being less worried about other spheres (crowding out). We argue that the determinants of the mechanisms are related to the type of CE, that a person's professional background moderates the influence of a CE on his or her worries, and that the subsequent development of worries is affected by whether institutional responses are contested. The analysis is based on longitudinal data of the German Socio-Economic Panel.","Ehlert","Trouble on my mind: the effect of catastrophic events

Further, most existing research has not included intimate partners of cancer patients, although they also experience FCR. This study aimed to (1) determine whether FCR is better conceptualized as a singular or multidimensional construct at the within-person level over time and (2) model the corresponding trajectories in patients and their partners. Methods Female early stage breast cancer patients and their partners (N = 78 couples) completed up to five assessments over the first year post-diagnosis tapping both emotional and cognitive elements of FCR. Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate FCR's factor structure, and multivariate latent growth curve modeling was used to estimate trajectories of emotional and cognitive FCR. Results FCR was best conceptualized as two distinct but related emotional and cognitive factors. In patients and partners, emotional FCR decreased over the first year post-diagnosis on average, while cognitive FCR did not change over time.

In this study, we examined to what extent perceived relative harms of e-cigarettes compared to cigarettes have changed in the USA. Methods We analysed the data from the longitudinal and nationally representative, Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study to assess the relative perceived harm of e-cigarettes amongst US adults between 2013 and 2016. Results The proportion of US adults who correctly perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes decreased each year from 41.1% (CI 40.1-42.1%) in 2013-2014, 31.5% (CI 30.8-32.2%) in 2014-2015 and 25.3% (CI 24.6-26.0%) in 2015-2016. Concurrently, the proportion of US adults who perceived e-cigarettes as equally, or more, harmful than cigarettes increased from 53.7% (CI 52.3-55.1%), 64.9% (CI 63.6-66.2%) to 72.7% (CI 71.5-73.9%) respectively. The proportion of US adults who held negative relative harm perceptions of e-cigarettes increased regardless of current smoking or vaping status by 24.6% and 29.6% respectively within 3 years. In Wave 3, the proportion of current smokers who perceived the relative harm of e-cigarettes as less harmful was lower at 29.3% (CI 28.2-30.4%) compared to current e-cigarette users at 43.5% (CI 40.3-46.7%). Former smokers who used e-cigarettes and believed that they were equally, or more, harmful than cigarettes in 2014-2015 had significantly higher rates of smoking relapse in the following year, 29% and 37% (p< 2.2e-16), respectively, compared to those with positive relative harm perceptions who reported relapse rates of 19%. Conclusions In this study, the proportion of US adults who incorrectly perceived e-cigarettes as equal to, or more, harmful than cigarettes increased steadily regardless of smoking or vaping status. Current adult smokers appear to be poorly informed about the relative risks of e-cigarettes yet have potentially the most to gain from transitioning to these products. The findings of this study emphasise the urgent need to accurately communicate the reduced relative risk of e-cigarettes compared to continued cigarette smoking and clearly differentiate absolute and relative harms. Further research is required to elucidate why the relative harm of e-cigarettes is misunderstood and continues to deteriorate.","Malt","Perception of the relative harm of electronic cigarettes compared to cigarettes amongst US adults from 2013 to 2016: analysis of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study data",2020,"population assessment for tobacco and health (path)","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data were analyzed using multilevel repeated measures and trend analyses. Results: In affected counselees, mean cognitions did not significantly differ over time, anxiety significantly decreased, and IES levels were increased immediately post-counseling. In unaffected counselees, cognitions significantly improved over time except for knowledge. Distress levels showed similar patterns as in affected women. Improvements in cognitions and distress were significantly smaller in affected versus unaffected women. Conclusion: Overall, counseling educates women about breast cancer risk and alleviates their anxiety. Importantly, benefits gained at immediate follow-up seem maintained over time. Practice implication: Affected women seem to benefit less from counseling. Counselors may need to devote more effort into educating these women and addressing their anxieties. Future studies should confirm the unexpected finding that cancer-related distress increased immediately post-counseling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The current longitudinal study is the first to examine how identity changes over time among smokers and ex-smokers and whether this can be predicted by socioeconomic status (SES) and psychosocial factors (i.e., attitude, perceived health damage, social norms, stigma, acceptance, self-evaluative emotions, health worries, expected social support). We examined identification with smoking (i.e., smoker self-identity) and quitting (i.e., quitter self-identity) among a large sample of smokers (n = 742) and ex-smokers (n = 201) in a cohort study with yearly measurements between 2009 and 2014. Latent growth curve modeling was used as an advanced statistical technique. As hypothesized, smokers perceived themselves more as smokers and less as quitters than do ex-smokers, and identification with smoking increased over time among smokers and decreased among ex-smokers. Furthermore, psychosocial factors predicted baseline identity and identity development. Socioeconomic status (SES) was particularly important. Specifically, lower SES smokers and lower SES ex-smokers identified more strongly with smoking, and smoker and quitter identities were more resistant to change among lower SES groups. Moreover, stronger proquitting social norms were associated with increasing quitter identities over time among smokers and ex-smokers and with decreasing smoker identities among ex-smokers. Predictors of identity differed between smokers and ex-smokers. Results suggest that SES and proquitting social norms should be taken into account when developing ways to facilitate identity change and, thereby, successful smoking cessation.","Meijer","Identity Change Among Smokers and Ex-Smokers: Findings From the ITC Netherlands Survey",2017,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it remains unclear how people's depressive symptoms change with the process of COVID-19. Further, there is also a paucity of research on the underlying antecedents and outcomes of depressive symptoms during this global health crisis. In this study, a longitudinal study was conducted in China and the data of 559 participants were collected from the outbreak period to the normalization period of the pandemic through self-report questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were longitudinally analyzed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Core variables involving society, family, individual cognition, and behaviors were studied as determinants or consequences. Latent growth curve model analyses indicated that college students had mild depressive symptoms at the initial stage of COVID-19 with a subsequent decreasing linear slope. Depressive symptoms were significantly predicted by college students' risk perception of COVID-19, social support, family functioning, and smartphone addiction tendency. Further, their depressive symptoms predicted the changes in smartphone addiction tendency and levels of hope. In conclusion, current findings can provide implications for future prevention and intervention of mental disorders to assist college students through such challenging times.","Wu","A longitudinal study on college students’ depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: The trajectories, antecedents, and outcomes",2023,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"correlation",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.54","0.34","0.5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"students",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"china",NA,NA,NA,NA,559,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.7,NA,NA,NA,NA,"20.42",NA,NA,NA,NA,1.39,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The outcome was smoking cessation as of follow-up (W3). Explanatory variables were sociodemographics, other tobac-co product use, adult at first cigarette, tobacco dependence, cancer diagnosis after baseline, and tobacco-related risk perceptions [cigarette harm perception, worry that tobacco products will dam-age one's health (worry), belief that smoking causes cancer (belief), and nondaily smoking harm perception].Results: Cessation was significantly associated with baseline worry (OR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.40), follow -up cigarette harm perception [OR = 2.01 (1.77-2.29)], and follow-up belief [OR = 1.40 (1.20-1.63)]. Cessation was inversely associated with follow-up (W3) worry, and this association was stronger among those without a cancer diagnosis (OR = 0.37 without cancer; OR = 0.76 among individuals diagnosed with cancer; interaction P = 0.001). Conclusions: Cessation is associated with tobacco-related risk perceptions, with different perceptions contributing in unique ways. Cessation is predicted by baseline worry but is inversely associated with worry at follow-up, suggesting that perhaps cessation has alleviated worry. The latter finding was stronger among respondents not diagnosed with cancer.Impact: Associations between cancer diagnosis, tobacco-related risk perceptions, and smoking behavior may inform the develop-ment of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions.","Land","Smoking Cessation and Tobacco-related Risk Perceptions among People with and without a Diagnosis of Cancer",2023,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cigarettes ; other: tobacco",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to develop and validate Health Care Workers' Concerns in Infectious Outbreaks Scale (HCWCIOS). MethodsThis exploratory sequential mix-method study was employed to design and validate the HCWCIOS. The initial tool was designed after searching similar studies and performing a qualitative phase under the semi-structured approach. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to evaluate the face and content validity. The content validity ratio, content validity index, and item-level content validity index were also calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to evaluate the construct validity. Using a convenient sampling method, 354 Iranian healthcare workers participated in the study. Computing Cronbach's alpha coefficient estimated the internal consistency for HCWCIOS and its subscales. Furthermore assessed was test-retest reliability. ResultsThe preliminary scale was designed with 57 items. By eliminating nine items in the content validity phase and 12 items during factor analysis, the final 36-item scale was developed on six factors: inadequate preparedness, lack of knowledge, risk perception, affected social relations, work pressure, and absenteeism. These six factors accounted for 46.507% of the total variance. The whole scale's Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.912, and the intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.88. ConclusionA 36-item HCWCIOS has good psychometric properties and is suitable for measuring healthcare workers' concerns during a pandemic.","Yarahmadi","Development and psychometric properties of health care workers’ concerns in infectious outbreaks scale",2023,"online repositories (can't find accession number)","longitudinal","concern",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: questionnaire validation",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.88",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"experts",NA,NA,NA,NA,"workers",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"iran",NA,NA,NA,NA,354,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Women with a history of peripartum depression (PPD) may be vulnerable to relapse. We sought to understand changes in depressive and anxious symptoms throughout the pandemic and which stressors increased symptoms in women with a history of PPD. In June 2020, all US participants with a history of PPD (n = 12,007) in the global MomGenes Fight PPD study were invited to the COVID-19 follow-up study. Respondents (n = 2163, 18%) were sent biweekly and then monthly surveys until January 31, 2022. We employed time-varying effects models to evaluate trajectories of depressive (patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9) and anxious (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD-7) symptoms and to estimate longitudinal associations between perceived stress, fears, COVID-19 case rates, and symptoms. Peaks of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS, and perceived COVID-19 risk scores corresponded with timing of national COVID-19 case surges. High perceived stress was the strongest predictor of PHQ-9 (beta = 7.27; P = 1.48e − 38) and GAD-7 (beta = 7.73; P = 6.19e − 70). Feeling lack of control and unlikely to survive increased PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores by 2 points. COVID-19 case rates, pandemic restrictions, and region were not independently associated with symptoms. This study suggests that the collective trauma of the pandemic has significantly affected mothers with a history of PPD, exemplified by high levels of perceived stress and the strong association with depressive and anxious symptoms. The next pandemic phase is uncertain, but will continue to influence mental health collectively and dynamically. Interventions must be flexible and responsive and should address fear, trauma, and feelings of control, particularly for mothers with a history of PPD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Bauer","The longitudinal effects of stress and fear on psychiatric symptoms in mothers during the COVID‑19 pandemic",2022,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA,NA,NA,NA,"19",NA,NA,NA,NA,"30",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; health catastrophe; other: mental health",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study proposes a mixed evaluation of COVID-19-related risk perception and affective responses among HCWs. Methods: A longitudinal mixed-method study was conducted. HCWs (N = 138) completed measures of COVID-19 risk perceptions, depression, anxiety, burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) at baseline and 6 months later. A subsample (n = 20) participated in semi-structured interviews exploring both risk perceptions and affective responses. Results: Main quantitative findings showed positive associations between worry to contaminate others and depression (IRR = 1.04, p < 0.05), anxiety (IRR = 1.03, p < 0.01), STS (b = 0.3, p < 0.05), and perceptions of lacking protection (IRR = 1.04, p < 0.05) with anxiety scores. Four themes emerged from the thematic content analysis: 1) life was turned upside down; 2) skills were put in quarantine; 3) dealing with patient discomfort; 4) balance to be found between protection and restrictions. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the importance to develop tailored interventions, such as group discussion sessions, to optimize risk perception and help manage uncertainty.","Grazioli","Risk Perception Related to COVID-19 and Future Affective Responses Among Healthcare Workers in Switzerland: A Mixed-Methods Longitudinal Study",2022,NA,"longitudinal","risk","worry",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"19",19,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"health catastrophe",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference","mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"not significant","not significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,138,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our study assessed consumers’ exposure to such claims and evaluated their impact on relative risk perceptions and e-cigarette use. Methods: Data are from the Assessment of the post-College Experience study, which followed a cohort of young adults since 2010 when they were college freshmen. We used data from survey waves 10 (fall 2017) through 14 (fall 2019) to assess past 6 month exposure to e-cigarette marketing that made smoking cessation or modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) claims. Logistic regression models examined if exposure to claims at waves 11 through 14 were predictors of e-cigarette use and relative risk perceptions at wave 14. Results: Exposure to MRTP (28.4% to 40.1%) and cessation claims (29.1% to 46.6%) increased, with participants reporting more exposure to cessation than MRTP claims at each wave. Multiple exposures were associated with perceptions that e-cigarettes are less harmful compared to cigarettes (Cessation: AOR = 1.12, CI: 1.01–1.23; p = 0.025; MRTP: AOR = 1.16; CI: 1.05–1.29; p = 0.003). Neither claim type was associated with past 30-day e-cigarette use. Claim exposure did not increase e-cigarette initiation among never e-cigarette users. However, current cigarette smokers who had never used e-cigarettes at wave 10 had 2.5 higher odds of initiating e-cigarette use by wave 14 for each exposure to a cessation claim (AOR = 2.53; CI: 1.43–4.45; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Young adults reported increasing exposure to unauthorized e-cigarette health claims. Exposure was associated with reduced relative risk perceptions, but was not associated with past 30-day e-cigarette use.

However, despite their effectiveness and safeness, a substantial portion of the population worldwide is hesitant to get vaccinated. In the current study, we examined whether fear of COVID-19 predicts vaccination willingness. In a longitudinal study (N = 938), fear for COVID-19 was assessed in April 2020 and vaccination willingness was measured in June 2021. Approximately 11% of our sample indicated that they were not willing to get vaccinated. Results of a logistic regression showed that increased fear of COVID-19 predicts vaccination willingness 14 months later, even when controlling for several anxious personality traits, infection control perceptions, risks for loved ones, self-rated health, previous infection, media use, and demographic variables. These results show that fear of COVID-19 is a relevant construct to consider for predicting and possibly influencing vaccination willingness. Nonetheless, sensitivity and specificity of fear of COVID-19 to predict vaccination willingness were quite low and only became slightly better when fear of COVID-19 was measured concurrently. This indicates that other potential factors, such as perceived risks of the vaccines, probably also play a role in explaining vaccination willingness. © 2022 The Authors","Mertens","Fear of COVID-19 predicts vaccination willingness 14 months later",2022,"https://osf.io/ryndg/","longitudinal","worry","risk",NA,NA,NA,"scale","single item",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: fear and vaccination",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,425,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The distribution of the age of initiation of hookah outcomes by perception levels of harmfulness and addictiveness are reported as cumulative incidence and 95% CI. Youth who perceived hookah to be neither harmful nor addictive were 173% more likely to initiate ever, 166% more likely to first report past 30-day use, and 142% more likely to first report fairly regular hookah use at earlier ages compared to youth who considered hookah to be both harmful and addictive. By age 18, 25.5% of youth who perceived hookah as neither harmful nor addictive were estimated to initiate ever hookah use while 9.3% of youth who perceived hookah as harmful and addictive were estimated to initiate ever hookah use.

Most research focused on the adverse mental health effects during the initial surge of cases; and yet little is known about approximately how workers are faring 1 year into the pandemic. The objective of this study is to examine stress, burnout, and risk perception in an academic medical system, 1 year after the start of the pandemic. Methods: HCW across care specialties participated in online surveys in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021. The surveys included questions related to workplace stress and risk perception related to COVID-19. Correlates of stress and burnout were explored using multivariable linear regression models. Professional Quality of Life Scale (PROQOL) questions were added to the second survey. Results: While HCW reported significantly fewer concerns about the risk of COVID-19 transmission to themselves and their families during the 2021 survey (compared with 2020), the percentage of workers who reported feeling excess stress at work or considered resigning stayed the same. One year into the pandemic, 57% of study participants met criteria for moderate or high levels of traumatic stress and 75% met criteria for moderate or high levels of burnout. As compared with participants who cared for no COVID-19 deaths, participants who cared for COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher traumatic stress (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, P = .007; >10: Coef. = 6.7, P<.001) and burnout scores (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, P = .004; >10: Coef. = 2.6, P = .036). Conclusion: While Although perceptions of risk declined over the course of the year, levels of stress still remained high despite high vaccination rates. Those who witnessed more COVID-19 deaths were more likely to report increased burnout and post-traumatic stress. As our nation continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants emerge it is imperative to focus on recovery strategies for high burnout groups to ensure the wellbeing of our health care workforce. © 2022 American Board of Family Medicine.

In a recent article in this journal, Dohle et al. (https://doi.org/10.32872/spb.4315) investigated the influence of risk perceptions and trust in politics and science on those constructs in March/April 2020. Since then, the pandemic has undergone several dynamic changes. We analyzed longitudinal data (N = 800) to investigate whether trust and risk were relevant predictors for pandemic measures at a later stage (October 2020/January 2021). The concept of risk perception was supplemented by risk attitude and affective risk to produce a more comprehensive picture of the risk component. We found that greater trust in science at time point 1 predicted less rejection and more adoption of measures at time point 2. Moreover, trust in politics predicted less rejection of measures. From all aspects of cognitive risk perception, only higher severity predicted lower rejection. All other cognitive aspects were non-significant. However, affective risk was shown to be a major predictor: the more the coronavirus was perceived as frightening and worrisome, the lower the rejection and more frequent the adoption of measures. Also, the higher the risk attitude related to health topics, the less frequent the implementation of measures. We replicated the analysis with predictors from time point 2 and deviations are discussed. Our results indicate that affective risk and general attitude toward health risk are more predictive of taking up measures in the context of COVID-19 than cognitive risk. © Authors 2021.","Ochel","Determinants of Adoption and Rejection of Protective Measures During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study in Germany’s Second Wave",2022,"https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/e2y5p","longitudinal","risk","risk","risk",NA,NA,"scale","scale","scale",NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,"8",87,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,2,NA,NA,"single","single","single",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,"health catastrophe; other: trust in politics",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,"mean difference","mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"not significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,90,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"germany","germany",NA,NA,NA,800,800,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship of two symptoms relevant to the disorder (worry and depressive symptoms) in the context of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) by using a cross-la-gged panel model (CLPM) analysis. Methods: A total of 92 adult patients with GAD were randomized to receive ten sessions of either acceptance‐based group behavioral therapy (ABBT) or nondirective supportive group therapy (NDST). Treatment had four time-point measures. Worries were measured using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and depression was measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-D). Results: The NDST model revealed significant paths from worry to depression (first wave) and from depression to worry (second wave). There was no other significant cross-lagged effect.

"221","Journal of Medical Internet Research",23,"11",NA,"10.2196/26743","Background: The foray of COVID-19 around the globe has certainly instigated worries in many people, and lockdown measures may well have triggered more specific worries. Sweden, more than other countries, relied on voluntary measures to fight the pandemic. This provides a particularly interesting context to assess people’s reactions to the threat of the pandemic. Objective: The general aim of this study was to better understand the worried reactions to the virus and the associated lockdown measures. As there have been very few longitudinal studies in this area published to date, development of feelings of worry over time was analyzed over a longer range than in previous research. Affective variables, worry in particular, were included because most of the research in this field has focused on cognitive variables. To employ new methodology, ecological momentary assessment was used for data collection and a multilevel modeling approach was adopted for data analysis. Methods: Results were based on an unbalanced panel sample of 260 Swedish participants filling in 3226 interview questionnaires by smartphone over a 7-week period in 2020 during the rapid rise of cases in the early phase of the pandemic. Causal factors considered in this study included the perceived severity of an infection, susceptibility of a person to the threat posed by the virus, perceived efficacy of safeguarding measures, and assessment of government action against the spread of COVID-19. The effect of these factors on worries was traced in two analytical steps: the effects at the beginning of the study and the effect on the trend during the study. Results: The level of general worry related to COVID-19 was modest (mean 6.67, SD 2.54 on an 11-point Likert scale); the increase during the study period was small, but the interindividual variation of both the worry level and its increase over time was large. Findings confirmed that the hypothesized causal factors (severity of infection, susceptibility to the threat of the virus, efficacy of safeguarding, and assessment of government preventive action) did indeed affect the level of worry. Conclusions: The results confirmed earlier research in a very special case and demonstrated the usefulness of a different study design, which takes a longitudinal perspective, and a new type of data analysis borrowed from multilevel study design. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

However, our knowledge of the interplay of these factors is limited, as is our knowledge of the patterns in risk attitudes and behaviours and their evolution over time. This study explores the interplay between attitudes and behaviours related to flood risk awareness and structural flood protection in two communities in the Eastern Italian Alps, and how they changed over time. To this end, a questionnaire was submitted to a total of 420 residents, in the year 2005 (N = 200) and 2018 (N = 220), and then analysed using Latent Class Analysis. No floods were recorded in the area during this period. The results show that there is a group of residents characterized by low risk awareness and high trust in structural flood protection. Such individuals are likely to live in urban – rather than mountain – communities and are characterized by a lack of or limited experience with floods. They are also prone to believe that such events will not happen in the future. In 2005, this group represented less than half of the sample, but its size substantially increased in 2018. This result has strong implications for local risk managers, because this group of residents is less risk aware than the others and they may deserve special attention and targeted messages in flood risk communication campaigns. This and other results are discussed, including the potential development of generalizable models to provide emergency and risk managers with tools to unveil risk awareness patterns and to tailor risk communication actions to citizens attitudes and behaviours. The paper ends with some considerations about the need not only to better understand but also to address diversity in flood risk awareness. © 2021","Franceschinis","Heterogeneity in flood risk awareness: A longitudinal, latent class model approach",2021,NA,"serial cross-sectional","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"natural catastrophe; other: floods",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reactions to terrorism (as with any other threat) involve emotional and cognitive components, and the degree to which they reciprocally interact is not well understood. Furthermore, much of the literature on the public response to terrorism is based on the construct of “risk perception,” whose precise definition and correlates are still ambiguous. This study aimed to more clearly disentangle the various emotional and cognitive facets that predict individuals’ response to the terrorism threat in the United States. We employed a longitudinal survey from a representative U.S. sample (n = 1057) and measured attitudinal and cognitive reactions to the threat of terrorism at both time points. An autoregressive latent variable model was used to assess the stability of such variables over time, as well as their reciprocal effects on one another. Participants’ emotional and cognitive reactions to the threat of terrorism evolved independently over time, contrary to the predictions of some prior risk perception literature. Furthermore, measurements of risk perception depended mostly on prior estimates of attack likelihood, emphasizing the importance of individuals’ assessments of hazard probability in the risk judgment process. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Baucum","Modeling affective and cognitive responses to soft‑target terrorism over time.",2021,"knowledgepanel®  https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"other: terrorism",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"test-retest",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.44",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,1052,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.52,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined parental HF in the T1D recent-onset period and evaluated whether continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) adoption relates to improved outcomes of parental HF. Methods: In TACKLE-T1D, a prospective study of five- to nine-year olds with recent-onset T1D, parents completed the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-Parents (HFS-P) at baseline (T1) and 6 (T2) and 12 (T3) months post-baseline. The HFS-P measures worry about hypoglycemia (HFS-Worry score) as well as hypoglycemia avoidance behaviors (HFS-Behavior score). We recorded CGM start dates for youth during the same time period through medical record review. Results: Between T1 and T2, 31 youth (32.3%) initiated CGM therapy, and between T2 and T3, an additional 17 youth (17.7%) began using CGM, leaving 48 youth who never initiated CGM therapy (50%) in the recent-onset period. Parents reported moderate HFS-Worry scores at T1 (32.9 ± 11.9), which increased between T1 and T2 (37.6 ± 11.4, P <.001) and plateaued between T2 and T3 (37.7 ± 12.4, P =.89). In contrast, parental HFS-Behavior scores decreased between T1 (33.1 ± 5.8) and T2 (32.2 ± 6.0, P =.005) and plateaued between T2 and T3 (32.2 ± 6.0, P =.95). Baseline HFS-Behavior and Worry scores were associated with increased adoption of CGM between T1-T2 and T2-T3, respectively. Parents of children initiating CGM therapy between T1 and T2 showed the largest decrease in HFS-Behavior (P =.03). Conclusions: Initiating CGM therapy within the first 12 months of T1D may help reduce parents’ use of hypoglycemia avoidance behaviors, but has little effect on parents’ hypoglycemia worry. © 2020 Diabetes Technology Society.","Youngkin","Continuous Glucose Monitoring Decreases Hypoglycemia Avoidance Behaviors, but Not Worry in Parents of Youth With New Onset Type 1 Diabetes",2020,NA,"longitudinal","worry",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"15",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; other: diabetes",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,"parents",NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,128,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.79,NA,NA,NA,NA,"36.8",NA,NA,NA,NA,6.4,NA,NA,NA,NA,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,"54",NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to determine the test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity and to perform factor analysis of a new falls Risk Perception Questionnaire (RPQ) in older community-dwelling adults with DM2. Methods: A prospective cohort of 30 community-dwelling older adults, ≥ 55 years, with DM2 was assembled. At baseline, perceived risk of falling, fear of falling and physical activity were measured. At time 2 (T2), at least 2 days later, perceived risk of falling was assessed again to determine the test-retest reliability of the RPQ. At time 3 (T3), approximately six weeks later, and time 4 (T4), at least 2 days after T3, perceived risk of falling was assessed by phone to determine the test-retest reliability of the RPQ when administered by phone. Results: The RPQ demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability when delivered in person (ICC = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.59–0.89) and by phone (ICC = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65–0.91), good internal consistency (α = 0.78) and adequate construct validity (r = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.20–0.74, p = 0.003) in older adults with DM2. Conclusion: Given the good psychometric properties in this sample of persons with Diabetes, the RPQ has the potential to be used in clinical practice as a risk assessment and fall prevention tool.

We aimed to explore whether different psychological factors were associated with the rate of chronic disease and disability accumulation over time. Design: population-based cohort study between 2001 and 2010. Setting: Swedish National study on aging and care in Kungsholmen. Subjects: adults aged 60 and older (N = 2293). Methods: linear mixed models were employed to study the association of life satisfaction, health outlook, resistance to illness, sickness orientation, and health worry with the rate of accumulation of chronic diseases and impaired basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Models were adjusted for demographic, clinical, social, personality and lifestyle factors. Analyses were repeated after excluding individuals with multimorbidity or disability at baseline. Results: high life satisfaction and positive health outlook were consistently associated with a lower rate of accumulation and progression of multimorbidity (β -0.064 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.116, -0.011; β -0.065 95% CI -0.121, -0.008, respectively) and disability (β -0.063 95% CI -0.098, -0.028; β -0.042 95% CI -0.079, -0.004, respectively) over time. This was true even for people without multimorbidity or disability at baseline and after adjusting for all covariates. Conclusions: positive attitudes toward life in general and health in particular may be especially important in old age, when the cumulative effects of biological and environmental deficits lead to accelerated health decline. These findings should encourage researchers to use measures of psychological well-being to better understand the multifactorial and diverse process of ageing. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We investigate the degree to which HIV risk perception is accurate, i.e. corresponds to actual HIV infection risks, in a general-population open-cohort study in Zimbabwe (2003–2013) including 7201 individuals over 31,326 person-years. Risk perception for future infection (no/yes) at the beginning of periods between two surveys was associated with increased risk of HIV infection (Cox regression hazard ratio = 1.38 [1.07–1.79], adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, and partner behaviour). The association was stronger among older people (25+ years). This suggests that HIV risk perception can be accurate but the higher HIV incidence (1.27 per 100 person-years) illustrates that individuals may face barriers to HIV prevention behaviour even when they perceive their risks. Gaps in risk perception are underlined by the high incidence among those not perceiving a risk (0.96%), low risk perception even among those reporting potentially risky sexual behaviour, and, particularly, lack of accuracy of risk perception among young people. Innovative interventions are needed to improve accuracy of risk perception but barriers to HIV prevention behaviours need to be addressed too, which may relate to the partner, community, or structural factors. © 2018, The Author(s).","Schaefer","Accuracy of HIV Risk Perception in East Zimbabwe 2003–2013",2018,"http://www.manicalandhivproject.org/data.html","longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"health; other: hiv",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3650,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"zimbabwe",NA,NA,NA,NA,7201,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.67,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet while most research on public terror reactions has focused on the construct of risk perception, the precise psychological nature of this construct remains ambiguous. Given the unique nature of soft-target terrorism as a threat, it is important to understand how the public perceives it over time, and precisely how public perceptions depend on individuals’ affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to this threat. Using a longitudinal survey of terrorism attitudes over six months, during which multiple high-profile terror attacks occurred, we test for 1) the effects of such events on participants’ risk perceptions, and 2) how participants’ risk perceptions depended on more basic psychological variables, such as fear or estimates of attack consequences and likelihood. We find that the 2016 Orlando shooting had a moderate impact on respondents’ risk perceptions, but not on expressed levels of fear or risk-reducing behaviors. Furthermore, risk perceptions were mostly impacted by prior estimates of terror attack likelihood, while risk-reducing behaviors only significantly depended on prior levels of fear.

Methods: Participants included pregnant adult women with gestational diabetes between 2009 and 2012 across seven diabetes clinics in Ontario, Canada. Data were collected through chart review and a survey that included a diabetes risk perception question. Results: Of the 614 of 902 women (68% response rate) with gestational diabetes, 89% correctly responded that gestational diabetes increases the risk for developing diabetes. However, 47.1% of women perceived themselves to be at low risk for developing diabetes within 10 years. On multivariable analysis, BMI < 25 kg/m2, absent previous gestational diabetes history, absent diabetes family history and absent insulin use were appropriately associated with low diabetes risk perception. However, compared with Caucasian ethnicity, high-risk ethnicity (Aboriginal, Latin American, West Indian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, Filipino, Black, Pacific Islander) [odds ratio (OR) 2.07; 95% CI 1.30–3.31] and East and South East Asian ethnicity (OR 2.01; 1.10–3.67) were associated with low diabetes risk perception. After further adjustment for immigration, only high-risk ethnicity remained a predictor of low diabetes risk perception (OR 1.86; 1.09–3.19), whereas East and South East Asian ethnicity did not (OR 1.67; 0.86–3.22). Conclusions: Although the majority of women recognized gestational diabetes as a risk factor for diabetes, almost half underestimated their personal high diabetes risk despite prenatal care. Furthermore, women from high-risk ethnic groups were more likely to underestimate their risk, even after adjusting for immigration. Interventions tailored to these groups are necessary to enhance perceived diabetes risk. © 2015 Diabetes UK","Mukerji","Educational and Psychological Issues Predictors of low diabetes risk perception in a multi-ethnic cohort of women with gestational diabetes mellitus",2016,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single item",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"health; other: diabetes",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We measured the impact of direct-to-consumer genomic risk information on changes to perceived risk (ΔPR) of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer among personal genomic testing (PGT) customers. We hypothesized that ΔPR would reflect directionality of risk estimates, attenuate with time, and be modified by participant characteristics. Methods: Pathway Genomics and 23andMe customers were surveyed prior to receiving PGT results, and 2 weeks and 6 months post-results. For each cancer, PR was measured on a 5-point ordinal scale from ""much lower than average"" to ""much higher than average."" PGT results, based on genotyping of common genetic variants, were dichotomized as elevated or average risk. The relationship between risk estimate and ΔPR was evaluated with linear regression; generalized estimating equations modeled this relationship over time. Results: With the exception of lung cancer (for which ΔPR was positive regardless of result), elevated risk results were significantly associated with positive ΔPR, and average risk results with negative ΔPR (e.g., prostate cancer, 2 weeks: least squares-adjusted ΔPR = 0.77 for elevated risk versus -0.21 for average risk; p-valuedifference < 0.0001) among 1154 participants. Large changes were rare: for each cancer, <4 % of participants overall reported a ΔPR of ±3 or more units. Effect modification by age, cancer family history, and baseline interest was observed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, respectively. A pattern of decreasing impact on ΔPR over time was consistently observed, but this trend was significant only in the case of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: We have quantified the effect on consumer risk perception of returning genetic-based cancer risk information directly to consumers without clinician mediation. Provided via PGT, this information has a measurable but modest effect on perceived cancer risk, and one that is in some cases modified by consumers' non-genetic risk context. Our observations of modest marginal effect sizes, infrequent extreme changes in perceived risk, and a pattern of diminishing impact with time, suggest that the ability of PGT to effect changes to cancer screening and prevention behaviors may be limited by relatively small changes to perceived risk. © 2015 Carere et al.","Carere","The impact of direct-to-consumer personal genomic testing on perceived risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer: findings from the PGen study",2015,NA,"longitudinal","risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,"scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"likert scale",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"temporal trend",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"adults",NA,NA,NA,NA,"usa",NA,NA,NA,NA,3160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19,NA,NA,NA,NA,"94",NA,NA,NA,NA

Study subjects were 1,095 female Australian participants of the Global Longitudinal study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW) untreated for osteoporosis at baseline. Study outcomes from self-administered questionnaires included calcium and vitamin D supplementation, self-reported seeking of medical advice regarding osteoporosis, BMD testing, and AOM use in the last 12 months at the late assessment. Logistic regression was used in the analysis. Concern significantly increased the likelihood of seeking medical advice and, however, had no significant impact on screening or treatment. Heightened self-perceived risks of osteoporosis and fracture both significantly increased the likelihood of seeking medical advice and BMD testing while elevated self-perceived risk of fracture increased AOM use. Supplementation use was not significantly associated with concern levels and risk perception. Concern and risk perceptions to osteoporosis and fracture were significantly associated with certain bone-protective behaviours. However, the disconnect between perceived osteoporosis risk and AOM use illustrates the need to emphasize the connection between osteoporosis and fracture in future education programs. © 2014 A. L.

The objectives of the current study were to examine, at 1-year follow-up: 1) risk perceptions of lung cancer and smoking-related diseases and behavior change determinants, 2) whether changes in risk perceptions differed by baseline screening result; and 3) whether changes in risk perceptions affected smoking behavior. METHODS: A 25-item risk perception questionnaire was administered to a subset of participants at 8 American College of Radiology Imaging Network/NLST sites before initial and 1-year follow-up screens. Items assessed risk perceptions of lung cancer and smoking-related diseases, cognitive and emotional determinants of behavior change, and knowledge of smoking risks. RESULTS: Among 430 NLST participants (mean age, 61.0 years; 55.6% men; 91.9% white), half were current smokers at baseline. Overall, risk perceptions and associated cognitive and emotional determinants of behavior change did not change significantly from prescreen trial enrollment to 1-year follow-up and did not differ significantly by screening test result. Changes in risk perceptions were not associated with changes in smoking status (9.7% of participants quit, and 6.6% relapsed) at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Lung screening did not change participants' risk perceptions of lung cancer or smoking-related disease. A negative screening test, which was the most common screening result, did not appear to decrease risk perceptions nor provide false reassurance to smokers.

The objective of this analysis was to examine the role of intimacy on perceptions of risk for an STD (PRSTD) and condom use within late adolescent females' main relationships. Methods: A clinical sample of African-American women aged 14-19 years at enrolment were followed prospectively for 3 years. At each semiannual interview, participants reported their partner-specific PRSTD, feelings of intimacy, perceptions of partner's concurrency and condom use at last sex for each of their main sex partners. Results: A total of 285 individuals reported 724 main relationships. Using generalised estimating equations, intimacy was negatively associated with risk perception, after adjusting for perceptions of partner concurrency (OR: 0.68; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.76). PRSTD was no longer associated with condom use after adjusting for intimacy (OR: 1.30; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.02. Conclusions: Intimacy was found to be associated with risk perception and condom use within adolescent main relationships. Adolescents may not view their intimate partners as sources of infection. The success of individual-level STD prevention efforts, such as condom promotion, might be limited as condoms may be in conflict with adolescents' expectations about intimate relationships.","Matson","The role of feelings of intimacy on perceptions of risk

A pretestposttest design was used to examine perceived risk and psychological functioning of individuals participating in a pancreatic cancer screening protocol. The screening protocol includes genetic counselling, transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood collection and eligible participants included individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer or BRCA2 mutation carriers. At baseline, participants (n = 198) showed low to moderate levels of risk perception, pancreatic cancer-related anxiety, and general distress. Participants with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) (n = 131) endorsed higher risk perception of pancreatic cancer than the BRCA2 carriers (n = 67) (perceived lifetime risk 42 vs. 15%), but did not differ on cancer worry or general distress prior to the first study appointment. From baseline to 3 months follow-up, no significant time or time by group interactions emerged on risk perception or general distress, but cancer worry decreased over time for the FPC group regardless of the number of affected relatives. Our findings indicate that participation in a pancreatic cancer screening program does not lead to a significant increase in risk perception, cancer worry, or general distress and that participants with high baseline levels of risk perception and distress may benefit from a more comprehensive risk assessment and psychological support. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Maheu","Pancreatic cancer risk counselling and screening: impact on perceived risk and psychological functioning",2010,NA,"longitudinal","risk","worry",NA,NA,NA,"single item","single item",NA,NA,NA,"range","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"1",1,NA,NA,NA,"2",2,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference","mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"not significant","significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,90,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,"clinical/patients","clinical/patients",NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"canadia","canadia",NA,NA,NA,198,198,NA,NA,NA,0.51,0.51,NA,NA,NA,"56.4",56.4,NA,NA,NA,9.2,9.2,NA,NA,NA,32,32,NA,NA,NA,"89",89,NA,NA,NA

Persons with low perception of their cancer risk also had low worry levels. There were no significant changes over time in cancer risk perception or in quality of life. Conclusion: Counseling in a high risk population seems to decrease cancer worry and to increase cancer knowledge thus enabling a counselee to take well-informed decisions. Furthermore, according to our results, such interventions do not increase anxiety and do not modify the quality of life, but do not adjust their cancer risk perception.

As this continuing uncertainty may have a detrimental effect on their psychological well-being and it is possible that such results will be misinterpreted as indicating that no mutation is present, studying their effect is important. Methods: Sixty-one women undergoing such tests completed questionnaires 2 weeks after their blood was taken and at 1 week and 6 months after receiving a preliminary ""inconclusive"" result, i.e., indicating that two thirds of the BRCA1 gene had been tested and no mutation had been found so far. Results: Perceived likelihood of having a mutation and perceptions of cancer risk significantly decreased after receipt of the interim result. There were no changes in levels of psychological distress and worry about cancer, in intentions to have mammograms, to carry out breast self-examination, or to have prophylactic surgery. Conclusions: The continuing uncertainty does not seem to have increased distress; however, it is possible that the inconclusive result is being interpreted as a ""good news"" result, in view of the fact that perceptions of risk decrease after receipt of the result.","Bish","No news is (not necessarily) good news: Impact of preliminary results for BRCA1 mutation searches",2002,NA,"longitudinal","risk","worry",NA,NA,NA,"scale","scale",NA,NA,NA,"likert scale","likert scale",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",3,NA,NA,NA,"single","single",NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"cancer",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"mean difference","mean difference",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"significant","not significant",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,14,NA,NA,NA,"laypeople","laypeople",NA,NA,NA,"workers","workers",NA,NA,NA,"adults","adults",NA,NA,NA,"uk","uk",NA,NA,NA,61,61,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"52.1",52.1,NA,NA,NA,11.1,11.1,NA,NA,NA,32,32,NA,NA,NA,"74",74,NA,NA,NA
